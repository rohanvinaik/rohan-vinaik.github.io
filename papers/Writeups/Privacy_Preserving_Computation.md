## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Privacy Definitions

**Computational Privacy**: Security against polynomial-time adversaries
```
Adversary advantage: Adv[A] = |Pr[A wins] - 1/2|
Secure if: Adv[A] ≤ negl(λ) for security parameter λ
```

**Information-Theoretic Privacy**: Security against unbounded adversaries
```
Shannon Entropy: H(X|Y) = H(X)
Perfect privacy: Observing Y reveals no information about X
```

**Differential Privacy**: Statistical guarantee on individual contributions
```
ε-Differential Privacy:
  Pr[M(D) ∈ S] ≤ e^ε · Pr[M(D') ∈ S]
  where D, D' differ by one individual
```

### 1.2 Threat Models

**Honest-but-Curious (Semi-Honest)**:
- Adversary follows protocol correctly
- Attempts to learn from observed messages
- Defense: Cryptographic protocols revealing nothing beyond output

**Malicious**:
- Adversary may deviate arbitrarily
- May send incorrect messages or abort selectively
- Defense: Zero-knowledge proofs, verifiable computation

**Covert**:
- Rational adversary avoiding detection
- Won't cheat if likely caught
- Defense: Efficient detection mechanisms, penalties

### 1.3 Security Goals

**Confidentiality**: Data remains private
```
∀ adversary A, ∀ input x:
  Pr[A learns x from protocol] ≤ negl(λ)
```

**Integrity**: Results are correct
```
∀ adversary A, ∀ computation f:
  Pr[A causes incorrect output ≠ f(inputs)] ≤ negl(λ)
```

**Verifiability**: Outputs can be verified
```
∀ computation f, ∃ efficient verifier V:
  V(input, output, proof) → accept/reject
```

## 2. Cryptographic Building Blocks

### 2.1 Commitment Schemes

**Purpose**: Commit to value without revealing, later open commitment.

**Pedersen Commitment**:
```
Setup: Group G of prime order q, generators g, h
Commit(m, r): C = g^m · h^r
Open: Reveal (m, r), verify C = g^m · h^r

Properties:
  - Perfectly hiding (information-theoretic)
  - Computationally binding (discrete log assumption)
```

**Hash-Based Commitment**:
```
Commit(m): C = H(m || r) for random r
Open: Reveal (m, r), verify C = H(m || r)

Properties:
  - Computationally hiding (hash preimage resistance)
  - Perfectly binding (no collisions)
```

### 2.2 Oblivious Transfer

**Purpose**: Sender has messages (m₀, m₁); receiver learns m_b without sender learning b.

**1-out-of-2 OT Protocol**:
```
1. Receiver: Generate key pair (pk_b, sk_b), send pk_b
2. Sender: Encrypt c₀ = Enc(pk₀, m₀), c₁ = Enc(pk₁, m₁)
3. Receiver: Decrypt m_b = Dec(sk_b, c_b)

Security:
  - Receiver learns m_b only
  - Sender learns nothing about b
```

**OT Extension**:
- Base OTs: O(λ) expensive public-key operations
- Extended OTs: O(n) cheap symmetric operations
- Amortizes cost over many OTs

### 2.3 Secret Sharing

**Shamir Secret Sharing**:
```
Setup: Secret s, threshold t, n parties

Share Generation:
  1. Random polynomial f(x) = s + a₁x + ... + a_{t-1}x^{t-1}
  2. Share i: sᵢ = f(i)

Reconstruction (any t shares):
  s = Σᵢ sᵢ · λᵢ  (Lagrange interpolation)

Properties:
  - t-1 shares reveal no information
  - t shares uniquely determine s
```

**Additive Secret Sharing**:
```
Share: s = s₁ + s₂ + ... + sₙ (mod q)
Reconstruct: s = Σᵢ sᵢ (mod q)

Properties:
  - Simple, efficient
  - Requires all shares (threshold = n)
  - Supports homomorphic operations
```

### 2.4 Garbled Circuits

**Purpose**: Evaluate boolean circuit without revealing inputs.

**Construction**:
```
For each wire w: Two labels (w₀, w₁) for bit values
For each gate: Encrypt all input-output combinations
Evaluation: Given input labels, decrypt output label

Optimization: Point-and-permute (no trial decryption)
```

## 3. Privacy Frameworks

### 3.1 Homomorphic Encryption

**Capability**: Compute on encrypted data without decryption.

**Types**:
- **Partially Homomorphic**: One operation (+ or ×)
- **Somewhat Homomorphic**: Limited depth operations
- **Fully Homomorphic**: Arbitrary operations with bootstrapping

**CKKS Scheme** (Approximate arithmetic):
```
Operations on encrypted real numbers:
  - Addition: Enc(a) + Enc(b) = Enc(a + b)
  - Multiplication: Enc(a) × Enc(b) = Enc(a × b)
  - Scalar: c × Enc(a) = Enc(c × a)

Trade-offs:
  - Ciphertext expansion: 100-1000× plaintext size
  - Computation overhead: 1000-10000× slower
  - Noise accumulation requires bootstrapping
```

**Applications**:
- Secure aggregation (federated learning)
- Private machine learning inference
- Encrypted database queries

### 3.2 Secure Multi-Party Computation

**Goal**: Multiple parties jointly compute function on private inputs.

**GMW Protocol** (Boolean circuits):
```
1. Secret Sharing: Each party shares inputs
2. Circuit Evaluation:
   - XOR gates: Free (local computation)
   - AND gates: Require oblivious transfer
3. Output Reconstruction: Parties reveal output shares
```

**Performance**:
- Computation: O(n) in circuit size
- Communication: Main bottleneck (network rounds)
- Optimization: Preprocessing offline phase

### 3.3 Zero-Knowledge Proofs

**Purpose**: Prove statement truth without revealing why it's true.

**Properties**:
- **Completeness**: Valid proofs always verify
- **Soundness**: Invalid proofs rarely verify
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Proof reveals nothing beyond validity

**zk-SNARKs** (Succinct non-interactive proofs):
```
Proof size: Constant (< 1 KB)
Verification: Fast (milliseconds)
Application: Property verification without data revelation
```

### 3.4 Differential Privacy

**Mechanisms**:
```
Laplace Mechanism:
  Output = f(D) + Lap(Δf/ε)
  where Δf = sensitivity, ε = privacy budget

Gaussian Mechanism:
  Output = f(D) + N(0, σ²)
  where σ ∝ Δf/ε for (ε, δ)-DP
```

**Composition**:
```
Sequential: k queries, each ε-DP → Total (kε)-DP
Advanced: ε√(2k log(1/δ))-DP (sub-linear growth)
```

**Applications**:
- Statistical queries on sensitive data
- Private data release
- Federated analytics

### 3.5 Trusted Execution Environments

**Intel SGX**:
- Hardware-isolated memory enclaves
- Remote attestation proves code execution
- Sealing: Encrypt data tied to enclave

**Properties**:
- Near-native performance (1-3% overhead)
- Memory limit: Typically 128 MB
- Side-channel vulnerabilities (Spectre, etc.)

**Use Cases**:
- Confidential computation in cloud
- Secure key management
- Private data processing

## 4. Protocol Design Patterns

### 4.1 Layered Security

**Pattern**: Combine techniques for defense-in-depth.

```
Layer 1: Encryption at rest
Layer 2: Homomorphic computation / MPC
Layer 3: Secure communication channels
Layer 4: Zero-knowledge verification
Layer 5: Differential privacy noise
```

**Benefits**:
- Multiple independent protection mechanisms
- Failure of one layer doesn't compromise entire system
- Flexibility to adjust security levels

### 4.2 Selective Protection

**Pattern**: Apply heavyweight cryptography only where necessary.

**Decision Framework**:
```
1. Data sensitivity level?
   - HIGH → Full MPC or FHE
   - MEDIUM → TEE with verification
   - LOW → Simple encryption

2. Computation complexity?
   - HIGH → TEE for performance
   - LOW → HE or MPC acceptable

3. Verification needed?
   - YES → Add ZK proofs
   - NO → Skip verification overhead
```

### 4.3 Privacy Budgeting

**Pattern**: Track cumulative privacy loss across queries.

```
class PrivacyAccountant:
    def __init__(self, total_epsilon):
        self.total_epsilon = total_epsilon
        self.spent_epsilon = 0
    
    def can_query(self, query_epsilon):
        return self.spent_epsilon + query_epsilon <= self.total_epsilon
    
    def execute_query(self, query, query_epsilon):
        if not self.can_query(query_epsilon):
            raise PrivacyBudgetExceeded()
        result = add_noise(query(), query_epsilon)
        self.spent_epsilon += query_epsilon
        return result
```

### 4.4 Hybrid Approaches

**Pattern**: Combine complementary techniques.

**Examples**:
- MPC + Differential Privacy: Secure computation with statistical guarantees
- HE + ZK: Encrypted computation with correctness proofs
- TEE + Attestation: Hardware security with remote verification

   - Execute queries on encrypted data
   
3. Synthetic Data:
   - Generate differentially private synthetic dataset
   - Release for unrestricted analysis
```

### 5.3 Secure Outsourcing

**Problem**: Perform computation on untrusted servers.

**Approaches**:
```
1. Homomorphic Encryption:
   - Encrypt data before sending
   - Server computes on encrypted data
   - Client decrypts results

2. Verifiable Computation:
   - Server provides proof of correct execution
   - Client verifies proof efficiently
   
3. TEE-Based:
   - Use hardware enclaves on server
   - Attestation proves correct execution
```
