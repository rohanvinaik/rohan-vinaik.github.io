- "More is different" (P.W. Anderson)
- Strong vs weak emergence debate
- Downward causation questions

**Key Distinction**:
- Self-organization: Process (how order arises)

- Related but not identical concepts

### 1.2 Characteristics

**Common Features**:

## 2. Thermodynamic Foundations

### 2.1 Far-From-Equilibrium Systems

### 2.3 Free Energy and Order
