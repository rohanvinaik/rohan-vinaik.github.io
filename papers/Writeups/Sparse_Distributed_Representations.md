## 1. Core Concepts and Definitions

### 1.1 What is Sparsity?

**Sparsity Definition**:
- Fraction of active units: k/n where k << n
- Typical values: 1-10% activation
- Binary: {0,1}^n with Hamming weight k
- Real-valued: Most elements near zero, few large values

**Types of Sparsity**:
- **Lifetime sparsity**: Single representation, few active units
- **Population sparsity**: Across ensemble, each unit rarely active
- **Temporal sparsity**: Over time, individual unit fires rarely
- **Spatial sparsity**: Across space, few regions active

**Mathematical Formalizations**:
- L0 norm: ||x||_0 = |{i : x_i ≠ 0}|
- L1 norm: ||x||_1 = Σ|x_i| (convex relaxation)
- Hoyer sparseness: (√n - ||x||_1/||x||_2) / (√n - 1)
- Gini coefficient: Measure inequality of activation distribution

### 1.2 What is Distribution?

**Distributed Representation**:
- Information spread across multiple units
- No single unit represents whole concept
- Contrast: Localist (one unit = one concept)

**Holographic Property**:
- Each unit participates in multiple representations
- Each concept distributed across multiple units
- Damage to subset of units → Graceful degradation
- Related to: Content-addressable memory, associative recall

**Population Coding**:
- Ensemble activity represents stimulus
- Redundancy: Multiple units encode same information
- Noise tolerance: Average over ensemble reduces noise
- Coarse coding: Overlapping receptive fields

### 1.3 Why Sparse + Distributed?

**Advantages of Combining**:

1. **Representational Capacity**:
   - Dense distributed: ~2^n distinct patterns (but similarity issues)
   - Sparse distributed: C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!) patterns
   - For n=1000, k=10: ~10^23 patterns
   - All patterns approximately orthogonal

2. **Metabolic Efficiency**:
   - Biological constraint: Energy cost per spike
   - Sparse firing reduces total energy consumption
   - Information per spike higher when firing rare
   - Landauer's principle: Minimum energy per bit

3. **Interference Reduction**:
   - Sparse patterns less likely to overlap
   - Reduces crosstalk in superposition
   - Easier pattern separation
   - Higher storage capacity in associative memories

4. **Biological Plausibility**:
   - Cortical neurons fire sparsely (~1 Hz typical, ~100 Hz max)
   - Only 1-4% of neurons active in cortical region at given time
   - Energy budget: Brain ~20% of body's energy, constraints exist
   - Evolution pressure toward efficiency

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 Information Theory

**Shannon Information**:
- Entropy of sparse code: H = -Σ p_i log p_i
- For sparse code with p_active = k/n:
  - H_sparse ≈ k log(n/k) - k + O(k²/n)
  - Compared to dense: H_dense ≈ n log(2) = n bits
- Information per active unit higher in sparse regime

**Channel Capacity**:
- Sparse channel: Limited k active out of n
- Capacity: C = log C(n,k)
- Optimal when patterns maximally separated
- Trade-off: Sparsity vs capacity vs noise tolerance

**Mutual Information**:
- I(X;Y) between input X and sparse code Y
- Maximized when: Patterns capture statistical structure
- Information bottleneck: Compression while preserving relevant information

### 2.2 Orthogonality and Similarity

**Approximate Orthogonality**:
- Random sparse patterns quasi-orthogonal in high dimensions
- Expected dot product: E[⟨x,y⟩] ≈ k²/n for random sparse vectors
- For k << n: Near-zero overlap
- Allows: Large number of distinguishable patterns

**Similarity Metrics**:
- Hamming distance: d_H(x,y) = Σ |x_i - y_i|
- Cosine similarity: cos(θ) = ⟨x,y⟩/(||x|| ||y||)
- Overlap: |x ∩ y| / |x ∪ y|
- For sparse: Metrics become approximately equivalent

**Concentration of Measure**:
- High-dimensional phenomenon
- Most pairs of random vectors near-orthogonal
- Distance between random points concentrates around mean
- Blessing of dimensionality for sparse codes

### 2.3 Capacity and Scaling

**Storage Capacity**:
- Hopfield network: C_max ≈ 0.14n for random dense patterns
- Sparse patterns: C_max ≈ n²/(2k log n) patterns
- For k << n: Exponential improvement
- Modern Hopfield (Dense Associative Memory): Exponential capacity

**Scaling Laws**:
- Pattern capacity: Scales with C(n,k)
- Robustness to noise: Scales with √n
- Computational cost: O(n) for sparse operations vs O(n²) for dense
- Memory footprint: O(kN) for N patterns

**Information per Synapse**:
- Dense networks: ~0.14 bits per synapse (Hopfield limit)
- Sparse networks: Can achieve higher with structured sparsity
- Biological synapses: Estimated ~1-2 bits per synapse
- Gap suggests additional optimization principles
