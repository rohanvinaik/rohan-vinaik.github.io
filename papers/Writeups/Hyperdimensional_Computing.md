## Abstract

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), represents a brain-inspired computational paradigm encoding information in extremely high-dimensional vector spaces (typically 1,000-10,000+ dimensions). The framework enables robust, efficient computation through algebraic operations: binding (contextual association), bundling (superposition), and permutation (sequential encoding). HDC provides theoretical foundations for distributed representations, compositional semantics, and similarity-based reasoning with applications across pattern recognition, cognitive architectures, and neuromorphic systems.

**Keywords**: Hyperdimensional computing, vector symbolic architectures, distributed representations, compositional algebra, semantic encoding

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Distributed Holographic Representation

Information is encoded across all dimensions of a hypervector, with no single dimension bearing disproportionate responsibility for any information piece. This holographic property ensures that partial information remains accessible even when portions of the representation are corrupted or lost.

**Formal Property**:
```
For hypervector h ∈ {-1,+1}^d:
  Each dimension contributes equally to information content
  Damage to subset does not destroy representation
```

**Implications**:
- **Robustness**: Graceful degradation under noise or partial loss
- **Redundancy**: Information distributed uniformly prevents single points of failure
- **Parallelism**: Operations on dimensions can execute simultaneously

### 1.2 Quasi-Orthogonality in High Dimensions

**Johnson-Lindenstrauss Theorem**: Random projection from n-dimensional space to k-dimensional space preserves pairwise distances with high probability when k = O(log n / ε²).

**Application to HDC**:
```
Random hypervectors A, B ∈ {-1,+1}^d:
  E[cos(A,B)] = 0
  Var[cos(A,B)] = 1/d

At d = 10,000:
  Random vectors have similarity ≈ 0.00 ± 0.01
```

This quasi-orthogonality allows representing millions of distinct concepts with negligible interference when dimensionality is sufficiently high (typically d ≥ 1,000).

### 1.3 Compositional Semantics

Meaning emerges from relationships and composition rather than isolated representations. Algebraic operations (bind, bundle, permute) preserve semantic relationships through the geometric structure of the high-dimensional space.

**Example Structure**:
```
# Individual components
variant_A = random_hypervector(d)
position_1 = random_hypervector(d)

# Meaning emerges through binding
variant_at_position = bind(variant_A, position_1)

# Further composition
genome = bundle([
    bind(variant_A, position_1),
    bind(variant_B, position_2),
    ...
])
```

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 Vector Space Structure

**State Space**:
```
Ω_HD = {-1, +1}^d  (binary/bipolar)
    or ℝ^d         (real-valued)
    or ℂ^d         (complex)
```

Standard choice is binary/bipolar for hardware efficiency and deterministic behavior. Hypervectors are typically normalized to unit length (||h|| = 1).

### 2.2 Dimensionality Requirements

**Theoretical Minimum**:
```
For N distinct items, collision probability P:
  d_min ≥ log₂(N) / (1 - P)

Example: N = 1M items, P < 0.01%
  d_min ≥ 20 dimensions
```

**Practical Requirements**:
- Simple classification: 1,000-2,000 dimensions
- Text/NLP: 5,000-10,000 dimensions
- Complex multi-modal: 10,000-50,000 dimensions

**Rule of Thumb**: d ≥ 10 × log₂(N) for robust performance.

### 2.3 Information Capacity

**Holevo's Bound** (from quantum information theory):
```
Classical approximation for HDC:
  Capacity ≈ d × H(p)
  where H(p) = binary entropy of dimension distribution
```

**Practical Implications**:
```
d = 10,000 dimensions
Effective capacity ≈ 4,000 bits (with typical sparsity)
Compression possible: 4×10⁹ bases → 10,000 dimensions
```

### 2.4 Distance Metrics

**Cosine Similarity** (primary metric):
```
sim(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)

For normalized hypervectors:
  sim(A, B) = A · B

Range: [-1, 1]
  +1: Identical
   0: Orthogonal (unrelated)
  -1: Anti-correlated
```

**Hamming Distance** (binary):
```
d_H(A, B) = Σᵢ |Aᵢ - Bᵢ|

For bipolar {-1,+1}:
  d_H(A, B) = d × (1 - sim(A,B)) / 2
```

**Euclidean Distance** (real-valued):
```
d_E(A, B) = ||A - B||₂

Relationship to cosine:
  d_E² = 2(1 - sim(A,B))  for unit vectors
```

## 3. Fundamental Operations

### 3.1 Binding (⊙): Contextual Association

**Purpose**: Create composite representations associating multiple concepts.

**Methods**:
```
# Circular convolution
bind_conv(A, B) = ifft(fft(A) * fft(B))

# Element-wise multiplication (bipolar)
bind_mult(A, B) = A * B  # element-wise

# Permutation-based (non-commutative)
bind_perm(A, B) = A * permute(B)
```

**Key Properties**:
1. **Approximate Invertibility**: unbind(A ⊙ B, B) ≈ A
2. **Similarity Preservation**: If sim(A₁, A₂) = s, then sim(A₁ ⊙ C, A₂ ⊙ C) ≈ s
3. **Commutativity** (for multiplication): A ⊙ B = B ⊙ A

### 3.2 Bundling (⊕): Superposition

**Purpose**: Aggregate multiple items into single representation preserving properties of all constituents.

**Definition**:
```
bundle(h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ) = normalize(Σᵢ hᵢ)

Binarization: sign(Σᵢ hᵢ)
```

**Key Properties**:
1. **Similarity to Constituents**: For bundle B = ⊕{A₁, ..., Aₙ}, sim(B, Aᵢ) ≈ 1/√n
2. **Commutativity**: Order-independent aggregation
3. **Associativity**: (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C = A ⊕ (B ⊕ C)

### 3.3 Permutation (π): Sequential Encoding

**Purpose**: Encode positional or sequential information.

**Definition**:
```
permute(h, k) = circular_shift(h, k)

Properties:
  π⁻¹(π(A)) = A  (exact invertibility)
  sim(A, B) = sim(π(A), π(B))  (similarity preservation)
  π(A) ⊙ B ≠ A ⊙ π(B)  (non-commutativity encodes order)
```

**Applications**:
- Position encoding: position[i] = π^i(base_position)
- Sequential patterns: ordered pairs, temporal sequences
- Linkage structures: spatial relationships

## 4. Encoding Schemes

### 4.1 Random Encoding

**Use Case**: Atomic concepts with no inherent structure (categorical data).

**Method**:
```
Generate deterministic random hypervector:
  rng = RandomState(seed=hash(item_id))
  h = rng.choice([-1, 1], size=d)
```

**Properties**:
- Deterministic: Same input → same output
- Orthogonal: Different items have ~0 similarity
- No semantic structure: Only distinctness encoded

### 4.2 Semantic Encoding

**Use Case**: Items with inherent relationships (numerical values, hierarchies).

**Method**:
```
For value v in range [min, max]:
  α = (v - min) / (max - min)
  h_v = normalize((1-α) × h_min + α × h_max)
```

**Properties**:
- **Similarity Preservation**: Similar values → high similarity
- **Continuity**: Smooth transitions between values
- **Interpolation**: Values between encoded points well-represented

### 4.3 Compositional Encoding

**Use Case**: Structured objects with multiple attributes.

**Method**:
```
For object with attributes {attr₁: val₁, attr₂: val₂, ...}:

1. Encode each attribute:
   key_hv = random_encode(attr_name)
   value_hv = encode_value(attr_value)
   
2. Bind key-value pairs:
   component = bind(key_hv, value_hv)
   
3. Bundle all components:
   object_hv = bundle([component₁, component₂, ...])
```

**Query Operations**:
```
# Retrieve attribute value
query = bind(object_hv, inverse_bind(key_hv))
# Compare to known values to find match
```

## 5. Information-Theoretic Properties

### 5.1 Compression

**Compression Ratio**:
```
CR = Size_original / Size_HD

Example:
  Original: 4×10⁹ bases × 2 bits/base = 1 GB
  HD: 10,000 dims × 1 bit/dim = 1.25 KB
  CR = 800,000×
```

**Information Preservation**:
```
Mutual Information: I(X; H) / H(X)
Measured by similarity preservation
Quality depends on encoding scheme and dimensionality
```

### 5.2 Privacy Properties

**Information-Theoretic Security**:
```
Number of possible originals mapping to hypervector:
  |G| / |H| = 2^(original_bits) / 2^(hd_bits)

Without projection matrix: Exponentially large search space
```

**Geometric Privacy**:
- High-dimensional projections obscure original structure
- Random projections provide mathematical privacy guarantees
- Similarity queries possible without reconstruction

### 5.3 Error Tolerance

**Bit Error Rate Resilience**:
```
For BER = p (fraction corrupted bits):
  Expected similarity: sim_corrupted ≈ (1 - 2p)

Graceful degradation:
  p = 0.10 → sim ≈ 0.80
  p = 0.30 → sim ≈ 0.40
```

Unlike symbolic systems (catastrophic failure at single bit flip), HDC maintains partial correctness under corruption, making it suitable for noisy or analog hardware.
