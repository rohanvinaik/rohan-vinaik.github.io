## 1. Fundamental Concepts

### 1.1 What is Scale?

**Types of Scale**:
- **Spatial**: Molecular → Cellular → Tissue → Organ → Organism → Ecosystem
- **Temporal**: Femtoseconds → Milliseconds → Seconds → Hours → Years → Eons
- **Organizational**: Individual → Group → Population → Community → Society
- **Energy**: Quantum → Thermal → Chemical → Mechanical
- **Information**: Bits → Bytes → Messages → Databases → Knowledge

**Scale Separation**:
- Well-separated: Clear gap between scales (ε << λ)
- Continuum: Scales blend smoothly
- Intermediate: Partial separation, interactions across scales

**Dimensionless Numbers**:
- Reynolds number (Re): Inertial/viscous forces
- Péclet number (Pe): Advection/diffusion
- Knudsen number (Kn): Mean free path/characteristic length
- Determine: Dominant physics at each scale

### 1.2 Hierarchy

**Definition**: Organization into nested levels where each level emerges from lower levels and constrains them

**Types**:
- **Structural hierarchy**: Physical containment (atom→molecule→cell→organ)
- **Control hierarchy**: Supervisory relationships (genes→proteins→networks)
- **Functional hierarchy**: Levels of abstraction (logic gates→circuits→computers)
- **Temporal hierarchy**: Nested timescales (fast→medium→slow processes)

**Near-Decomposability** (Simon):
- Interactions within level >> interactions between levels
- Enables: Semi-independent analysis of levels
- Limitation: Cross-scale interactions can be important

### 1.3 Emergence Across Scales

**Weak Emergence**:
- Higher-level properties derivable from lower level (in principle)
- Computational complexity makes derivation impractical
- Example: Thermodynamics from statistical mechanics

**Strong Emergence**:
- Higher-level properties not deducible from lower level
- New laws or principles required
- Controversial: Does it exist in nature?

**Downward Causation**:
- Higher levels constrain lower levels
- Example: Organism's goals guide cellular behaviors
- Debates: Reduction vs autonomy of levels

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 Renormalization Group (RG)

**Core Idea**: Systematically eliminate fine-scale details to obtain effective large-scale description

**RG Transformation**:
- Coarse-grain: Average over small-scale fluctuations
- Rescale: Restore original lattice spacing
- Iterate: Obtain flow in parameter space

**Fixed Points**:
- Attractive: Critical points, universality classes
- Repulsive: Unstable, rare
- Flow diagrams: Trajectories in parameter space

**Applications**:
- Phase transitions (Ising model, percolation)
- Quantum field theory (running couplings)
- Turbulence (Kolmogorov theory)
- Neural networks (deep learning as RG flow)

### 2.2 Homogenization Theory

**Problem**: Media with fine-scale heterogeneity

**Approach**:
- Periodic microstructure with period ε << 1
- Asymptotic expansion in ε
- Effective medium: Homogeneous with averaged properties

**Example (Heat Conduction)**:
```
Microscale: -∇·(k(x/ε)∇u_ε) = f
Macroscale: -∇·(k_eff∇u_0) = f

k_eff: Effective conductivity (homogenized)
```

**Applications**:

**Continuous Wavelet Transform**:
```
W(a,b) = ∫ f(t)ψ*((t-b)/a) dt

a: Scale (dilation)
b: Position (translation)
ψ: Mother wavelet
```

- Φ_CG = M·Φ_fine (projection operator M)
- Derive: Effective interactions for CG system

**Force Matching**:

- Have microscopic simulator
- Use simulator as "oracle" for coarse variables

**Lifting and Restriction**:
- Lifting: Coarse state → Compatible fine state
- Restriction: Fine state → Coarse state
- Not unique: Many fine states consistent with coarse

**Coarse Timestepper**:
