## Abstract

We present a comprehensive roadmap of open mathematical problems and required proofs for establishing the Constraint-Oriented Emergent Computation (COEC) framework on rigorous theoretical foundations. This document catalogs 25 key theorems, proofs, and derivations spanning measure theory, computational complexity, information theory, topology, and category theory. For each problem, we indicate its current status in the literature, estimated computational complexity class, disciplinary perspective, and practical outlook. This roadmap serves as both a guide for theoretical researchers and a transparency document showing which aspects of COEC rest on established results versus novel contributions requiring original proof work.

**Keywords:** Constraint satisfaction, computational complexity, proof theory, mathematical foundations, theoretical computer science

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of This Document

The Constraint-Oriented Emergent Computation (COEC) framework synthesizes concepts from multiple mathematical and computational disciplines—measure theory, information theory, computational complexity, algebraic topology, category theory, and quantum mechanics. While COEC's core intuitions and applications are relatively accessible, establishing the framework on completely rigorous foundations requires a systematic program of formal proofs and derivations.

This document serves several purposes:

1. **Transparency**: Clearly identifying which theoretical claims rest on established results versus those requiring novel proof work
2. **Roadmap**: Providing a structured program for theoretical researchers to contribute to COEC's foundations
3. **Prioritization**: Distinguishing between proofs essential for core claims versus those extending the framework into new domains
4. **Collaboration**: Enabling researchers from different disciplines to identify problems matching their expertise

### 1.2 Document Structure

Each proof goal is characterized along five dimensions:

1. **Statement**: Succinct description of what needs to be proved
2. **Discipline**: Primary mathematical or computational perspective required
3. **Status**: Whether the proof already exists in literature, needs COEC-specific adaptation, or is entirely novel
4. **Complexity**: Estimated computational complexity class of the natural decision problem (where applicable)
5. **Outlook**: Assessment of feasibility and timeline for completion

### 1.3 Priority Classification

We organize proofs into three priority tiers:

**Essential (Proofs 1-8)**: Required for core COEC claims about universality, entropy dynamics, and constraint satisfaction. Without these, fundamental theoretical assertions remain ungrounded.

**Important (Proofs 9-17)**: Strengthen specific COEC classes, establish connections to existing frameworks, or provide efficiency guarantees. These are needed for COEC to compete with established alternatives.

**Exploratory (Proofs 18-25)**: Extend COEC into cutting-edge domains (quantum computing, higher category theory, cosmology). These expand the framework's reach but aren't essential for core applications.

### 1.4 Reading Guide

**For theoretical mathematicians**: Focus on proofs marked "No (COEC-specific)" or "No" under Status—these represent novel contributions to pure mathematics potentially publishable independently of COEC applications.

**For computer scientists**: Prioritize proofs related to computational complexity (16-18, 24) and algorithmic implementation (9, 12-14).

**For physicists**: Examine proofs connecting to thermodynamics (19), quantum mechanics (18, 21), and cosmology (10).

**For applied researchers**: Understand which proofs underpin practical applications (1-8 are most critical), versus which enable theoretical extensions.

## 2. Proof Catalog

The following table presents 25 key proof goals for establishing COEC's mathematical foundations. We use the following notation:

- **Exists?**: Whether a formal proof already exists in conventional literature
  - *Yes*: Can cite existing proof
  - *Partial*: Core ideas exist but need COEC-specific adaptation
  - *No (COEC-specific)*: Need to adapt established technique to COEC context
  - *No*: Entirely novel proof required
  
- **Complexity**: For decision problems, the complexity class (P, NP-complete, BQP, etc.)
  - For non-decision problems, marked with † to indicate the complexity refers to computing the relevant quantity

### 2.1 Essential Foundations (Priority 1)

| # | Proof Goal | Discipline | Exists? | Complexity | Outlook |
|---|------------|------------|---------|------------|---------|
| **1** | **Well-formedness of the 7-tuple ontology** | Measure Theory, Probability | Yes | **P** | Straightforward formalization using standard measure theory. Can cite Rudin (1987) for measure space foundations. Requires showing $(S, C, E, \Phi, R, I, P)$ forms a well-defined mathematical structure with appropriate consistency conditions. |
| **2** | **Constraint-consistent trajectories (fixed-point guarantee)** | Non-linear Analysis, Dynamical Systems | Yes | **P** | Apply Browder-Göhde-Kirk fixed-point theorem or Banach contraction principle. Need to verify constraint operators satisfy non-expansion and convexity conditions. Brouwer's theorem provides existential guarantee; constructive proof requires additional work. |
| **3** | **Lyapunov convergence for SS- & DB-COEC** | Control Theory | Yes | **P** | Standard Lyapunov stability theory applies directly. Define $V_C(\omega) = \sum_i p_i \cdot \max(0, \theta_i - c_i(\omega))^2$ and show $\frac{dV_C}{dt} < 0$ outside constraint-satisfying set. Khalil (2002) provides comprehensive treatment. |
| **4** | **Entropy monotonicity $\Delta I \geq 0$ under constraints** | Information Theory, Thermodynamics | Yes | **P** | Follows from Jensen's inequality applied to convex function $-\log$. Can cite Cover & Thomas (2006). Need to verify applicability conditions (finite second moments, proper conditional expectations) hold in COEC systems. |
| **5** | **Variational free energy $\simeq$ Active-Inference update** | Variational Calculus, Bayesian Brain | Yes | **P** | Friston's (2010) free energy principle provides foundation. Need to show COEC's $F(s) = E_{\text{physical}}(s) + \sum_i w_i \cdot c_i(s)$ is equivalent to variational free energy $F = D_{KL}[q \|\| p] - \mathbb{E}_q[\log p(o \| s)]$ under appropriate mappings. |
| **6** | **Strong-Turing universality of COEC** | Computability Theory | Yes | **RE / undecidable** | Proof by construction: build COEC system simulating universal Turing machine. Let $S$ = tape + head state, $C$ = transition rules, $\Phi$ = single-step evolution. Since UTM is universal, COEC inherits universality. Halting problem remains undecidable. |
| **7** | **Busy Beaver upper bound for exhaustive constraint search** | Computability Theory | Yes | **Uncomputable** | Direct application of Busy Beaver function $BB(n)$ definition. Any algorithm exhaustively exploring state space of size dependent on $BB(n)$ encounters uncomputability barrier. Rado (1962) established $BB(n)$ is not computable. |
| **8** | **Catalytic-space compression theorem** | Reversible / Space Complexity | Yes | **PSPACE-complete** | Buhrman et al. (2014) proved $\text{CSPACE}(s(n)) \subseteq \text{SPACE}(s(n)^2)$. Need to verify COEC systems satisfy reversibility conditions for catalytic memory. Two-phase simulation (forward + backward) establishes quadratic bound. |

**Commentary on Essential Proofs:**

These eight proofs establish COEC's basic mathematical coherence and computational properties. All rest on established mathematical results, requiring primarily careful verification that COEC systems satisfy the necessary technical conditions. The Strong-Turing universality (Proof 6) is particularly important as it places COEC definitively within the landscape of computational models.

The catalytic space result (Proof 8) is perhaps the most technically sophisticated, relying on recent advances in space complexity theory. Its practical significance is that biological systems can solve complex problems with limited dedicated resources—a key advantage of constraint-based computation.

### 2.2 Important Extensions (Priority 2)

| # | Proof Goal | Discipline | Exists? | Complexity | Outlook |
|---|------------|------------|---------|------------|---------|
| **9** | **Sheaf-cohomology gluing lemma for global consistency** | Algebraic Topology, Sheaf Theory | Yes | **P** | Standard sheaf theory (Mac Lane & Moerdijk, 1992). Need to construct COEC sheaf $\mathcal{F}: \text{Open}(\Omega_S)^{\text{op}} \to \text{Vec}$ and verify sheaf axioms. $H^1 = 0$ guarantees global sections exist. |
| **10** | **Stability of persistent homology under ε-perturbations** | Computational Topology, TDA | Yes | **P** | Stability theorem (Cohen-Steiner et al., 2007): $W_\infty(PD_f, PD_g) \leq \|f - g\|_\infty$. Directly applicable to TDA-COEC. Ensures topological constraints are robust to measurement noise and small system perturbations. |
| **11** | **Hypervector hash-collision (JL + Chernoff bound)** | Random Projections | Yes | **P** | Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma plus Chernoff bounds on tail probabilities. For $D = O(\log n / \varepsilon^2)$ dimensional projection, similarity preserved with probability $\geq 1 - \delta$. Kanerva (2009) provides application to hyperdimensional computing. |
| **12** | **Proof-of-Constraint ledger security** | Cryptography, Blockchain Security | Yes | **Assumed hard** | Standard cryptographic assumptions: second-preimage resistance of hash function, collision resistance. Merkle tree construction provides $O(\log n)$ proof size. Security reduces to underlying hash function (typically SHA-256 or Blake2). |
| **13** | **Runtime drift audit theorem** | Statistical Learning Theory | Yes | **P** | Hoeffding inequality or Azuma-Martingale inequality for concentration. Given $n$ samples, deviation from expected behavior exceeds $\varepsilon$ with probability $\leq 2e^{-2n\varepsilon^2}$. Enables statistical monitoring of constraint satisfaction over time. |
| **14** | **Energy-landscape sculpting optimality (PL-condition)** | Optimization Theory | Yes | **P** | Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition: if $\|\nabla f(x)\|^2 \geq \mu(f(x) - f^*)$ then gradient descent converges at rate $O(1/\gamma)$ where $\gamma = 1/(1-\mu\eta)$. Need to verify COEC energy landscapes satisfy PL condition near attractors. |
| **15** | **Multi-scale categorical product preserves computability class** | Category Theory | Yes | **P** | Products in $\mathcal{C}_{\text{COEC}}$ computed componentwise. If each factor has computability class $C_i$, product has $\max_i C_i$. Limits and colimits in category of computational models preserve complexity bounds (standard categorical result). |
| **16** | **Constraint-to-SAT reduction: any finite COEC $\leq_p$ SAT** | Computational Complexity | No (COEC-specific) | **NP-complete** | Need explicit polynomial-time reduction. For constraint $c_i(\omega) > \theta_i$, create Boolean variables encoding state discretization. Constraint satisfaction becomes SAT instance. Key challenge: handling continuous constraints requires discretization with bounded error. |
| **17** | **Convex-COEC tractability: jointly convex potentials $\Rightarrow$ polynomial-time** | Convex Optimization | Partial (KKT) | **P** | If all constraint potentials $c_i$ and energy $E$ are convex, problem reduces to convex optimization. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions provide polynomial-time solution (interior point methods). Need to characterize which COEC systems admit convex formulation. |

**Commentary on Important Extensions:**

These proofs strengthen specific aspects of COEC and establish connections to well-established frameworks. Proofs 9-11 enable practical implementations (sheaf consistency for distributed systems, topological stability for robustness, hypervector efficiency for semantic representation). Proofs 12-14 address verification and monitoring—critical for deploying COEC systems in practice.

The constraint-to-SAT reduction (Proof 16) is particularly important for establishing COEC's relationship to classical computational complexity theory. While the general idea is clear (discretize and encode as Boolean satisfiability), the formal proof requires careful attention to discretization errors and encoding efficiency.

### 2.3 Exploratory Frontiers (Priority 3)

| # | Proof Goal | Discipline | Exists? | Complexity | Outlook |
|---|------------|------------|---------|------------|---------|
| **18** | **Quantum-COEC advantage: BQP ⊆ Q-COEC and √ speedup** | Quantum Computing, Query Complexity | Yes (BQP results) | **BQP (≥ NP?)** | Grover's algorithm (1996) provides $\sqrt{N}$ speedup for unstructured search. Need to embed in COEC framework: represent constraints as quantum operators, show entanglement enables non-local constraint satisfaction. BQP containment follows from standard quantum complexity theory. |
| **19** | **Minimal work bound: COEC transition obeys Landauer** | Statistical Physics, Non-eq Thermodynamics | Yes (Landauer) | **P** | Landauer's principle (1961): erasing information requires $W \geq k_B T \ln 2$ per bit. COEC transitions changing information by $\Delta I$ bits require $W \geq k_B T \Delta I \ln 2$. Need to show constraint satisfaction qualifies as information processing subject to Landauer bound. |
| **20** | **Sheafified Active-Inference equivalence** | Category Theory, Probabilistic Graphical Models | No | **P** | Novel synthesis: show Bayesian network $\leftrightarrow$ co-sheaf on state-constraint poset. Conditional independence structure corresponds to sheaf restrictions. Local belief propagation = constraint message passing. Requires developing categorical semantics for active inference. |
| **21** | **Homotopy-lifting robustness** | Algebraic Topology | No (COEC context) | **P** | If fibres over constraint manifold have trivial fundamental group ($\pi_1 = 0$), then constraint satisfaction is path-connected—system can move between solutions continuously. Applies homotopy lifting property from fibre bundle theory. Need to characterize when COEC systems admit fibre bundle structure. |
| **22** | **Error-correcting capacity of hypervector embeddings** | Coding Theory, Random Hypervectors | Partial (LDPC) | **P** | Hypervector robustness analogous to error-correcting codes. Minimum distance $d_{\min}$ between codewords bounds syndrome decoding radius $r \leq \lfloor(d_{\min}-1)/2\rfloor$. Need to compute $d_{\min}$ for random hypervector ensembles and binding/bundling operations. |
| **23** | **Distributed fixed-point (multi-agent COEC)** | Distributed Algorithms, Topological Concurrency | Partial (Banas, Dijkstra) | **P (poly-msg)** | For asynchronous distributed system, conditions for global constraint equilibrium: (1) local constraints compatible, (2) message passing preserves information, (3) eventual consistency. Extends Dijkstra-Scholten termination detection and Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithms. |
| **24** | **Probabilistic completeness of COEC search** | Probabilistic Algorithms, Measure Concentration | No | **BPP** | If solution set has measure $\geq \varepsilon$, then randomized constraint sampler finds solution with high probability after $O(1/\varepsilon)$ samples. Requires showing COEC systems satisfy measure concentration properties. Relates to PAC-learning framework. |
| **25** | **Index theorem for COEC manifolds** | Differential Geometry, Atiyah-Singer | No | **P**†‡ | Hypothetical generalization of Atiyah-Singer index theorem: Euler characteristic of COEC manifold relates topological invariants to computational resource budget. Would link topology directly to complexity. Highly speculative but potentially deep connection. |

**Notes:**
- †: Complexity refers to computing the relevant quantity rather than a decision problem
- ‡: (25) is mostly algebraic-topological bookkeeping, not a search problem, so "P" reflects computable-in-poly-time character

**Commentary on Exploratory Proofs:**

These proofs extend COEC into cutting-edge domains or establish connections to deep mathematical structures. Proof 18 (quantum advantage) is closest to practical realization, building on established quantum computing results. Proofs 20-21 (sheafified active inference, homotopy lifting) would establish elegant categorical/topological perspectives but aren't essential for applications.

Proof 24 (probabilistic completeness) is particularly important for practical implementations, as it would guarantee that simple randomized search succeeds given sufficient sampling. The index theorem (Proof 25) is highly speculative—if it exists, it would represent a deep connection between topology and computation worthy of independent mathematical interest.

## 3. Cross-Disciplinary Dependencies

Many proofs require synthesizing techniques from multiple disciplines. We identify key interdisciplinary connections:

### 3.1 Information Theory + Thermodynamics

**Proofs 4, 19**: Establishing that COEC constraint satisfaction is genuine information processing subject to thermodynamic limits requires unifying Shannon entropy with physical entropy. The key technical challenge is showing that constraint satisfaction performs irreversible logical operations subject to Landauer's bound.

### 3.2 Topology + Complexity Theory

**Proofs 10, 21, 25**: Connecting topological properties (persistence, homotopy, index) to computational complexity. The hypothesis is that topological obstructions correspond to computational barriers—loops that can't be contracted represent problems that can't be efficiently solved.

### 3.3 Quantum Mechanics + Constraint Satisfaction

**Proof 18**: Showing that quantum superposition and entanglement enable fundamentally more efficient constraint satisfaction. Requires proving that certain constraint networks become tractable with quantum resources that are intractable classically—going beyond Grover's speedup to problem-specific advantages.

### 3.4 Category Theory + Distributed Systems

**Proofs 9, 15, 20, 23**: Using categorical abstractions (sheaves, limits, functors) to reason about distributed constraint satisfaction. The goal is to find conditions under which local constraint satisfaction glues into global solutions—essentially, when "thinking locally" suffices versus when global coordination is required.

---

## 4. Strategic Priorities

### 4.1 Short-Term (1-2 years)

**Priority**: Complete essential foundations (Proofs 1-8)

**Approach**: These proofs adapt established results to COEC context. A small team of 2-3 researchers with expertise in computational complexity and information theory could verify these systematically.

**Deliverable**: A formal foundations paper establishing COEC's mathematical coherence and placing it precisely within the computational hierarchy.

### 4.2 Medium-Term (2-5 years)

**Priority**: Important extensions (Proofs 9-17), especially:
- Proof 16 (constraint-to-SAT reduction) for complexity theory positioning
- Proof 17 (convex-COEC tractability) for efficient implementation
- Proofs 12-14 (security and monitoring) for practical deployment

**Approach**: Collaborate with specialists in each domain. Several proofs (9, 10, 11, 14, 15) are straightforward applications of existing results. Others (16, 17) require novel technical work.

**Deliverable**: Series of domain-specific papers showing COEC applications in optimization (17), complexity theory (16), and secure distributed computing (12-14).

### 4.3 Long-Term (5+ years)

**Priority**: Exploratory frontiers (Proofs 18-25), particularly:
- Proof 18 (quantum advantage) as quantum hardware matures
- Proof 24 (probabilistic completeness) for practical algorithm design
- Proof 20 (sheafified active inference) for theoretical unification

**Approach**: Support PhD students and postdocs pursuing high-risk, high-reward theoretical problems. Not all may succeed, but successes would significantly advance the field.

**Deliverable**: Breakthrough papers in quantum computing (18), learning theory (24), or mathematical physics (25) that establish COEC as a major theoretical framework.

---

## 5. Collaborative Opportunities

### 5.1 For Pure Mathematicians

**Proofs 9, 15, 20, 21, 25**: These involve sophisticated mathematical structures (sheaves, category theory, homotopy theory, index theory) with potential for publication in pure mathematics journals independent of COEC applications. Proof 25 in particular, if successful, would be a significant result in differential geometry.

### 5.2 For Theoretical Computer Scientists

**Proofs 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24**: Core computational complexity questions. Proof 16 (constraint-to-SAT reduction) and Proof 17 (convex-COEC tractability) are particularly important for positioning COEC relative to existing computational models. Proof 24 addresses fundamental questions about randomized algorithms.

### 5.3 For Physicists

**Proofs 3, 4, 5, 19**: Connections between computation and physics. Proof 19 (Landauer bound) is especially important for establishing that COEC respects fundamental thermodynamic limits. Physicists working on non-equilibrium thermodynamics or information physics would find these problems natural.

### 5.4 For Applied Mathematicians

**Proofs 10, 11, 13, 14, 22**: Practical questions about stability, robustness, and optimization. These proofs enable confidence in COEC implementations and provide guarantees for real-world applications. Applied mathematicians in numerical analysis, optimization, or signal processing would find these accessible.

---

## 6. Open Problems and Future Directions

Beyond the 25 catalogued proofs, several deeper questions remain:

### 6.1 Fundamental Limits

**Question**: Are there constraint satisfaction problems that COEC systems can solve efficiently but conventional computers cannot, even in principle (not just constant factors)?

This would require identifying problems beyond BQP (for quantum COEC) or in some non-standard complexity class. Candidate areas: problems involving real-number computation, problems with topological obstructions, or problems requiring true parallelism.

### 6.2 Constraint Expressiveness

**Question**: Can every computable function be expressed as a constraint satisfaction problem with polynomial overhead?

This is related to Proof 16 but more general. A positive answer would establish constraint satisfaction as a universal computational paradigm. A negative answer would identify fundamental limitations.

### 6.3 Optimality of Biological Systems

**Question**: Do biological COEC systems operate at fundamental efficiency limits (e.g., Landauer bound, quantum Cramér-Rao bound)?

This would require detailed experimental measurements combined with theoretical analysis. If true, it would suggest evolution has discovered optimal constraint-based computation. If false, it identifies room for improvement in bio-inspired designs.

### 6.4 Consciousness and Constraint Integration

**Question**: Does Integrated Information Theory's Φ correspond to some measure of constraint network complexity in COEC?

Proof 5 establishes connections to Free Energy Principle. A similar formal connection to IIT would link COEC to theories of consciousness, with profound implications for understanding subjective experience.

---

## 7. Conclusions

This roadmap identifies 25 key proofs establishing COEC's mathematical foundations and extending it into new domains. The proofs span:

- **8 essential foundations** (Proofs 1-8): Mostly adaptations of established results, achievable in 1-2 years
- **9 important extensions** (Proofs 9-17): Mix of straightforward applications and novel technical work, achievable in 2-5 years
- **8 exploratory frontiers** (Proofs 18-25): High-risk, high-reward problems potentially requiring 5+ years and breakthrough insights

Several themes emerge:

1. **Mathematical maturity**: COEC's foundations rest primarily on established mathematics (measure theory, functional analysis, information theory). The challenge is careful verification, not inventing new mathematics.

2. **Interdisciplinary synthesis**: The most interesting problems (e.g., Proofs 20, 21, 25) require bridging multiple disciplines—category theory with machine learning, topology with complexity theory, geometry with computation.

3. **Practical impact**: Even "theoretical" proofs have practical implications. Proof 17 (convex-COEC tractability) directly enables efficient implementations. Proof 12 (ledger security) enables trusted deployment.

4. **Research opportunities**: This roadmap provides ~10-15 PhD thesis topics and numerous smaller projects for masters students or collaboration.

COEC's theoretical development is thus a collaborative program requiring expertise from multiple disciplines. This document provides a structured approach to that program, enabling researchers to identify problems matching their skills while understanding how their contributions fit into the larger framework.

We invite the research community to engage with these problems, whether pursuing individual proofs, developing broader theoretical connections, or applying COEC principles to new domains. The roadmap is intentionally comprehensive to accommodate diverse research interests while maintaining coherence around the central vision of constraint-oriented computation.
