## 1. Introduction

The development of advanced artificial intelligence systems increasingly draws inspiration from the remarkable efficiency and adaptability of biological neural systems. This paper investigates a critical intersection of cognitive science and computational paradigms: semantic encoding through hyperdimensional representations. This approach aims to endow AI systems with human-like capacities for understanding and manipulating meaning, transcending superficial pattern matching.

### 1.1 Semantic Encoding: Cognitive Foundations

Semantic encoding constitutes a fundamental cognitive process wherein information is converted into memory based on its meaning or significance rather than superficial physical attributes [1]. As a "deep processing" method, semantic encoding actively focuses on semantic content, associating new information with existing knowledge to establish meaningful connections. This deep engagement substantially enhances long-term memory retention [1], contrasting sharply with shallow encoding forms such as visual or acoustic processing, which typically produce weaker memory traces [2].

The cognitive science literature distinguishes semantic encoding from related memory processes. Unlike sensory encoding, which captures immediate perceptual features, or episodic encoding tied to contextual details of personal experiences, semantic encoding prioritizes abstract meaning and information significance [1]. The levels-of-processing theory posits that cognitive processing depth directly correlates with memory strength and durability. As a deep-level process, semantic encoding produces more robust and enduring memory formation compared to shallow methods [1]. Elaborative rehearsal strategies, which actively link new information to existing knowledge, promote semantic encoding and significantly improve memory performance [1]. Furthermore, this deep processing enhances retrieval cue effectiveness during memory recall by creating rich, meaningful associations within stored memories [2].

The explicit grounding of semantic encoding within cognitive science provides a crucial blueprint for AI design. Integration of semantic encoding with hypervectors represents a deliberate effort to infuse AI systems with principles derived from human cognition. The emphasis on "deep processing" and information "meaning" in human memory directly informs the design philosophy of AI systems pursuing sophisticated, human-like intelligence. This connection highlights a foundational neurocognitive motivation for Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), positioning them as brain-inspired approaches seeking to emulate robust and efficient mechanisms by which biological brains store and retrieve meaningful information. This interdisciplinary framework draws from neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer engineering, fostering holistic AI development [3].

### 1.2 Hyperdimensional Computing: A Brain-Inspired Paradigm

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), often termed Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), represents a computational paradigm particularly relevant for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [5]. Its inception derives from observations of biological neural systems, specifically the cerebellar cortex, which operates on high-dimensional data representations [5]. In HDC, information is encoded and manipulated as "hyperdimensional vectors" or "hypervectors"—vectors typically comprising thousands of elements (e.g., 1,000 to 10,000 dimensions) [5]. These vectors may consist of real, binary, or bipolar values [7].

HDC directly emulates key principles of brain function, including remarkable abilities to perform complex tasks with low power consumption, low precision, and inherent robustness to data corruption [9]. The observation that brains with different architectures and internal codes can achieve equivalent computational outcomes, with details established through environmental interaction, inspires HDC's design for functional equivalence and adaptability [29].

High dimensionality constitutes a cornerstone of HDC, enabling the existence of vast numbers of mutually or nearly orthogonal vectors [5]. This property ensures randomly generated vectors are highly distinct and dissimilar, crucial for robust representation [7]. While conventional machine learning often views high dimensionality as a "curse" due to increased computational cost, data sparsity, and visualization difficulties, HDC explicitly embraces very high dimensionality as a core design principle. This is fundamental to achieving properties such as vast numbers of nearly orthogonal vectors, which are exploited for robust encoding and efficient computation. This represents a paradigm shift in approaching dimensionality in AI, reframing a common computational challenge into a core advantage. This approach suggests biological neural systems may implicitly utilize similar high-dimensional principles to achieve remarkable robustness and flexibility in cognitive functions.

A defining characteristic of HDC is its distributed or holographic representation, where information is "smeared out" across all dimensions of a hypervector. No single component bears disproportionate responsibility for storing information [5]. This inherent redundancy renders HDC systems remarkably robust to noise and data corruption [5]. Even individual bit errors or partial damage to hypervectors result in representations remaining "close" to correct vectors, leading to graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure [5]. This robustness can also translate into computational savings by reducing requirements for explicit error-correcting mechanisms [5].

HDC enables computation through a rich algebra of hypervectors. Information is processed by combining hypervectors into new ones using well-defined vector space operations, forming underlying computing structures analogous to groups, rings, and fields [5]. These operations are typically simple, such as element-wise additions and dot products, performed directly in high-dimensional space [5]. A crucial aspect involves comparing hypervectors to quantify concept relatedness using metrics such as cosine similarity, Hamming distance, or percent overlap [5].

The inherent suitability of HDC for efficient hardware implementation is frequently emphasized [5]. This is not merely a practical benefit but a foundational motivation, particularly for emerging computing paradigms such as in-memory computing or computational memory based on nanoscale resistive memory or memristive devices [12]. The simplicity of HDC's core operations directly contributes to hardware efficiency [5]. The strong synergy between HDC's algorithmic principles and hardware implementation suggests its full potential can only be realized through holistic co-design approaches. This implies a future where AI algorithms are intrinsically linked to specialized, brain-inspired computing substrates, transcending limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures.

## 2. Principles and Mechanisms of Semantic Encoding

This section examines core principles governing semantic information representation and manipulation within the HDC framework, focusing on hypervector properties and fundamental algebraic operations.

### 2.1 Hypervector Properties and Meaning Representation

A central tenet of HDC is distributed and holographic information encoding. Objects or observations are represented by value patterns spread across many dimensions rather than localized in single constants [5]. This "holographic" property ensures information distributes uniformly over all hypervector components, meaning no single component holds disproportionate responsibility for any information piece [5]. This inherent redundancy is key to system robustness.

HDC provides systematic methodology for mapping physical world objects and abstract concepts into hypervectors for computational processing [5]. These high-dimensional vectors can represent diverse entities, from concrete items like recipe ingredients or molecular atoms to abstract concepts such as words in language or positions along an axis [7]. A classic example involves representing "SHAPE" and "COLOR" as distinct variables, with their respective values (e.g., "CIRCLE," "SQUARE," "BLACK," "WHITE") also mapped to hypervectors. These can be combined through operations to form composite representations, such as a "BLACK CIRCLE" [5].

HDC/VSA combines advantages of distributed vector representations with structured data representations found in symbolic AI [10]. This capability enables creation of complex, structured, and hierarchical representations. For instance, basic hypervectors representing individual words can combine to form sentence representations, or coordinates can combine to represent positions in multi-dimensional space [7].

While individual hypervectors represent distinct concepts, their "meaning" in the semantic sense is not localized to single, interpretable dimensions [17]. Instead, the holographic nature implies meaning is distributed. Crucially, semantic content emerges from how hypervectors combine through operations and how their similarity is measured [5]. For example, the meaning of "BLACK CIRCLE" is captured by a bound hypervector [5], where semantic content resides in the relationship between "color" and "shape" attributes rather than in isolated representations. This suggests a relational and compositional understanding of meaning.

This perspective fundamentally distinguishes HDC from purely symbolic AI, where symbols typically have predefined, atomic meanings. In HDC, meaning is dynamic, emergent, and relational, aligning more closely with connectionist theories of cognition while providing a framework for symbolic-like manipulation. This has profound implications for knowledge representation, acquisition, and reasoning in AI systems, potentially leading to more flexible and robust semantic understanding.

### 2.2 Core Operations for Semantic Compositionality

HDC/VSA is built upon a small yet powerful set of algebraic operations enabling hypervector manipulation and combination [5]. These operations are fundamental to building complex data structures and enabling semantic compositionality [10].

#### Bundling (Superposition)

Bundling is typically implemented as element-wise addition of hypervectors [5]. When working with binary or bipolar hypervectors, the sum is often followed by a "majority rule" or thresholding function to binarize results and ensure they remain within the original vector type [12]. The resulting hypervector is designed to be similar to all constituent operands [10]. From a cognitive perspective, bundling is often interpreted as "memorization" [32], allowing superposition of multiple information pieces into a single composite representation [5]. It effectively distributes information from all contributing hypervectors across the resulting bundled hypervector while retaining key features of the original set [10].

#### Binding

Binding is typically realized through element-wise multiplication [5]. For binary hypervectors, the XOR operation is commonly used [10]. The key characteristic is that output hypervectors are dissimilar to individual input operands [5], effectively "binding" them together into new, unique concepts. This operation has the important property of similarity preservation, meaning if H₁ is similar to H₂, then H₃ * H₁ will be similar to H₃ * H₂ [32]. Crucially, binding is approximately invertible, allowing recovery of constituent components from bound hypervectors [5]. Cognitively, binding is interpreted as "association of concepts" [23]. It is used to create ordered tuples [28] and to associate disparate data pieces into coherent wholes [32].

#### Permutation

Permutation involves rearranging elements within a hypervector [5]. In many implementations, especially with binary HDC, this is achieved through cyclic shifts of vector elements [19]. This operation is primarily utilized to encode order or sequence information within hypervectors [5]. Despite altering element positions, permutation preserves overall distribution and statistical properties of hypervectors [8]. Like binding, permutation is invertible, allowing recovery of original element order by applying inverse permutation [8].

These core HDC operations form a rigorous "algebra" [5] underpinning systematic manipulation of high-dimensional vectors. This mathematical foundation is explicitly linked to cognitive interpretations, such as bundling being interpreted as "memorization" and binding as "association of concepts" [23]. The inherent mathematical properties, including invertibility [5] and associativity/commutativity [8], are crucial for ensuring robust information processing and flexible retrieval in ways mirroring cognitive functions. This suggests HDC provides a formal, mathematical framework for modeling complex cognitive functions historically difficult to capture within traditional symbolic AI or that often remain opaque in purely connectionist neural networks. It offers a "white box" approach [13] to understanding AI system decision-making logic, representing significant progress toward interpretable Artificial Intelligence.

A critical design tension exists within HDC concerning the ability to easily retrieve individual components versus encoding complex relationships. For instance, sums of random hypervectors, while having high overlap with their elements and enabling easy readout, struggle to encode relations. Conversely, operations like circular convolution or permutation yield codes with cue-recoverable relations but exhibit low overlap to composition's base elements, precluding fast element readout without specific cues [36]. This indicates that optimizing for easy retrieval of individual components from bundled representations might compromise the ability to encode and retrieve complex relationships between elements, and vice versa. This highlights a crucial engineering and theoretical challenge: the choice of specific operations and encoding strategies involves inherent trade-offs. Different HDC models or encoding designs might be optimally suited for different semantic tasks, depending on whether the primary goal is robust set representation (bundling for memorization) or precise relational encoding (binding/permutation for associations and order).

### 2.3 Encoding Schemes and Compositional Structures

Semantic encoding in HDC involves mapping raw data into high-dimensional hypervectors using various specialized schemes facilitating formation of complex, compositional, and hierarchical representations. A common approach maps raw data to hypervectors using randomized encoding techniques designed to ensure similar input space data points map to nearby points in high-dimensional hyperspace, preserving semantic relationships [8].

HDC is highly versatile and "data agnostic," applicable to diverse data types including numerical scalars, vectors, sequences, images, and graphs [8]. For numerical data, various mapping techniques are employed. Orthogonal mapping assigns randomly chosen atomic hypervectors to each possible value, suitable for nominal data where values are independent. For ordinal or discrete data with natural ordering, linear mapping ensures closer values map to more similar hypervectors. A novel local linear mapping approach further refines this by splitting the value range into "splits" and applying linear mapping within each, emphasizing small differences while making distant values approximately orthogonal [19].

To encode sequential information or order, permutations of hypervector components are extensively utilized [21]. An example is Position-ID encoding, where each feature is assigned a key hypervector representing its position, and its value is mapped to a corresponding level hypervector [40]. For image data, features are often represented by compositional hypervectors, with permutations encoding positional information [36]. A sophisticated approach involves Point of Interest (POI) selection, where patches around salient pixels are encoded by binding their binary values with x and y position hypervectors within the patch. This local feature extraction is then combined with global positional information using local linear mapping [19].

The primary method for representing information with different attributes is associative binding. Each attribute (e.g., color, size) is assigned a series of vectors for its possible values, and a specific data point is represented by the element-wise product of vectors corresponding to its attributes. For example, an image representing the number "7" with "blue" color and "medium" size would be represented as H_blue,medium,7 = N_7 * C_blue * S_medium [32].

Core operations (bundling, binding, permutation) enable creation of intricate structured and hierarchical representations from atomic hypervectors [7]. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), this includes forming n-gram hypervectors for text classification [12] and then bundling these n-gram hypervectors from the same category to produce a "prototype hypervector" representing an entire class [12].

A striking feature of HDC encoding is its dual nature: it begins with randomly generated vectors, which are then systematically manipulated through structured algebraic operations. This balance allows for robustness (derived from inherent randomness and distributed nature) and precise semantic representation (achieved through structured composition). This enables the system to learn and adapt while maintaining a degree of interpretability in its representations.

## 3. Models and Algorithms

The HDC/VSA field encompasses a family of computational models, each with distinct characteristics in semantic encoding and hypervector manipulation. These models build upon core principles of high-dimensionality, distributed representation, and algebraic operations to achieve various cognitive and machine learning tasks.

### 3.1 Prominent HDC/VSA Architectures

The landscape of HDC/VSA models includes several prominent architectures: Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR), Binary Spatter Codes (BSC), Multiply-Add-Permute (MAP), Tensor Product Representations, and Sparse Binary Distributed Representations [4]. While sharing the fundamental concept of high-dimensional vector manipulation, they differ in specific vector types employed (e.g., real-valued, binary, bipolar) and exact mathematical implementation of binding and bundling operations.

### 3.2 Specific Encoding Mechanisms

The semantic encoding process within HDC/VSA models involves reducing an outer product back to a single D-dimensional vector, solving the combinatorial explosion problem that would otherwise arise from binding operations [18]. The specific reduction methods and vector nature define each model.

**Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)**: Developed by T. Plate, HRR models utilize real-valued vectors. Their binding operation is implemented through circular convolution, a mathematical process combining two vectors to produce a third, where information from inputs is distributed across the output in a holographic manner [4].

**Binary Spatter Codes (BSC)**: Introduced by P. Kanerva, BSC models operate with binary (0/1) vectors. In BSC, the binding operation is implemented as a component-wise (Hadamard) product, effectively ignoring off-diagonal matrix components that might be present in other models like Tensor Product Representations [18]. An illustrative example of BSC's capacity for analogical reasoning involves representing knowledge about countries. For instance, knowledge that Washington D.C. is the capital of the USA can be encoded as a bound hypervector. When comparing two countries, such as the USA and Mexico, their respective knowledge representations can be combined. Due to associative and commutative properties of vector binding and superposition, and the self-canceling property of BSC (where X⊕X results in a vector that is effectively an identity element for the binding operation), the resulting vector simplifies to highlight corresponding relationships between the two countries. This allows the system to answer queries like "What is the 'dollar of Mexico'?" by multiplying the combined vector by the "dollar" hypervector, which then simplifies to the "peso" hypervector. This demonstrates how BSC can derive semantic relationships without explicit decomposition [18].

**Multiply/Add/Permute (MAP) Model**: Proposed by R. Gayler, the MAP model also employs the Hadamard product for binding, similar to BSC, but uses bipolar (+1/-1) vectors instead of binary ones [4]. A key feature of MAP is that each vector is its own multiplicative inverse, advantageous for recovering individual elements from associations [18]. This self-inverse property, however, necessitates an additional mechanism to "protect" or "quote" associations embedded within others (e.g., in a sentence structure like "Bill knows that [John kissed Mary]"). To address this, MAP suggests using a permutation operation, also useful for encoding order or precedence. For instance, representing that item A comes before item B can be achieved by binding the vector for A with the permutation of the vector for B (A⊕ρ(B)) [18].

### 3.3 Adaptive and Learned Encoders

Traditional HDC approaches have often relied on static or manually selected encoders, meaning resulting high-dimensional representations were not optimally adapted to specific tasks [11]. This static nature can limit performance, as HDC representation quality heavily depends on hyperspace mapping choice and similarity metric, influenced by the distribution from which the encoding matrix is sampled [40].

Recent advancements address this limitation through adaptive and learned encoders. A novel approach called FLASH (Fast, Learnable, Adaptive, and Stays Holographic) learns the encoder matrix distribution via gradient descent, allowing adaptation to training data while preserving crucial holographic properties of HDC [40]. FLASH introduces an innovative hyperdimensional regression algorithm with an optimizable HDC encoder. Unlike previous algorithms, FLASH generates atomic hypervectors that truly adapt to training data, efficiently optimizing HDC representation for downstream tasks while maintaining the holographic property [40]. The process involves two-stage training: first, a generator function is learned to sample the encoding matrix from an optimized distribution, and then model training for the regression hypervector is performed with this adapted encoder [40]. This approach ensures FLASH maintains holographic HDC representation after tuning the encoder, unlike directly learning the encoding matrix and offset through gradient descent, which could jeopardize this property [40].

Another notable development is NeuralHD, which employs a dynamic encoder for adaptive learning and dimension regeneration [11]. These adaptive methods represent significant steps toward more flexible and high-performing HDC systems, transcending constraints of fixed encoding schemes.

## 4. Applications

The unique properties of hypervectors and their algebraic operations enable a wide range of applications, particularly in areas requiring robust, efficient, and cognitively inspired information processing.

### 4.1 Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition

HDC has demonstrated significant promise in various machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, often achieving competitive accuracy with lower computational requirements compared to conventional methods.

**Image Recognition**: HDC algorithms can classify images, replicating tasks typically performed by deep neural networks. This includes classifying annotated sets of handwritten digits, where features are analyzed to yield a hypervector per image. Prototypical hypervectors are created for each class (e.g., for the concept of "zero"), and unlabeled images are classified by comparing their hypervectors to these prototypes using similarity metrics like the dot-product [5]. HDC is also applied to general image classification and visual place recognition in changing environments, by systematically post-processing existing image descriptors and combining them with additional geometric or semantic information using VSA operations [12].

**Text Classification**: HDC has been successfully applied to tasks such as language classification and news classification. This involves selecting basis hypervectors to represent symbols (e.g., letters of the alphabet), combining them into n-gram hypervectors through binding operations, and then bundling these n-gram hypervectors to produce a prototype hypervector for each category [12].

**Biosignal Processing**: Applications extend to biomedical signal processing, including human activity recognition and hand gesture recognition [12].

**Temporal Patterns and Multimodal Sensor Fusion**: HDC shows promise in applications involving temporal patterns and the fusion of data from multiple sensor modalities [12].

### 4.2 Cognitive Computing and Artificial Intelligence

HDC's brain-inspired nature makes it particularly well-suited for cognitive computing tasks, aiming to emulate aspects of human thought and memory.

**Analogical Reasoning**: HDC has been employed for analogical reasoning, a complex cognitive process involving the transfer of information or meaning from a source domain to a target domain [3].

**Concept Learning**: Functional imitation of concept learning, such as observed in honey bees, represents another application of HDC in cognitive computing [12].

**Solving Raven's Progressive Matrices**: This classic abstract visual reasoning problem, a significant challenge for traditional artificial neural networks, has been successfully tackled using HDC with neural networks. This approach involves representing individual objects and their attributes as hypervectors and using algebra to predict the best fit for a blank position in a grid, often outperforming neural network-only solutions and offering significantly faster processing than symbolic logic methods [5].

**Cognitive Modeling**: VSA models, including the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA), provide a way to manipulate symbols and combine symbolic and numerical approaches for cognitive modeling, useful for complex human tasks like ill-defined problem-solving [42].

**Semantic Memory**: HDC contributes to modeling semantic memory, which involves recollection of ideas, concepts, and facts commonly regarded as general knowledge. This includes knowledge representation and pattern recognition, where hypervectors can represent and manipulate abstract visual objects and their compositions [45].

### 4.3 Natural Language Processing

Semantic encoding with hypervectors offers promising avenues for advancing Natural Language Processing, particularly in tasks requiring deep understanding of meaning and context.

**Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**: HDC, especially models like Binary Spatter Code (BSC), can be used for WSD. This involves assigning randomly constructed high-dimensional binary vectors to ambiguous terms and their senses. Semantic vectors for context terms are trained by combining these elemental vectors. When a new context is encountered, the relevant sense is recovered by applying an inverse binding operation to the context vector and the ambiguous term's elemental vector, and then finding the closest match among known senses. This approach distributes disambiguation information across semantic vectors, reconstituting the correct sense based on context [39].

**Text-based Applications**: HDC has shown promising accuracy and efficiency in various NLP tasks, including spam detection, sentiment analysis, and question answering, often with advantages such as compact model size, energy efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities compared to deep learning methods [48].

**Word Embeddings**: HDC can contribute to word embedding models, which represent words as high-dimensional semantic vectors. These vectors can encode contexts in which words appear, and advancements allow for capturing semantic similarity (e.g., "boat" – "ship") versus semantic relatedness (e.g., "boat" – "water") [36].

**Semantic Parsing**: HDC can be applied to semantic parsing, the process of mapping natural language sentences into formal representations of their meaning. This can help computers understand and answer questions, facilitate machine translation, and enable more natural human-computer interactions [50].

## 5. Challenges and Open Problems

Despite significant potential and demonstrated capabilities, semantic encoding with hypervectors within the HDC/VSA framework faces several challenges and limitations requiring ongoing research and development.

### 5.1 Computational and Representational Challenges

**Dimensionality Requirements**: Typically, large hypervector dimensions (e.g., ≥ 1000) are required to achieve accuracies comparable to conventional alternatives [9]. While high dimensionality is a core strength, unnecessarily large hypervectors increase hardware and energy costs, potentially undermining HDC's benefits [16].

**Computational Efficiency**: Larger dimensions imply higher energy consumption, longer inference time, and more hardware resources [16]. Consequently, redundant computations can undermine the benefits of using HDC over other learning algorithms. The encoding process alone can consume a significant portion of overall execution time, sometimes up to 80% of the training process [9].

**Data Encoding Overhead**: Some encoding algorithms can significantly increase the size of encoded data, potentially by up to 20 times [9]. There is an ongoing need to develop efficient encoding algorithms that can handle the inherent capacity limitations of HDC, ensuring the system can robustly represent a vast number of concepts and relationships [9].

**Random Mapping Limitations**: HDC often relies on a random mapping process to achieve high inference accuracy, which necessitates large dimensions. This randomness might not be ideal for precisely capturing and preserving specific semantic relationships without careful optimization, potentially leading to misclassification of data points around class boundaries [16]. If training data has gaps (e.g., certain levels are underrepresented), the classifier can make random choices, even if orthogonal hypervectors are assigned to each level [16].

**Data Density and Similarity**: For certain applications, such as MNIST digit recognition, high resemblance between some digits (e.g., "4" and "9") can lead to a high number of overlapped elements between their HD vectors, making analyzable patterns sometimes indistinguishable and prone to error [9].

### 5.2 Semantic and Structural Challenges

**Decomposition Problem**: While complex data structures can be built using binding operations, the reverse task of decomposing associated elements (i.e., recovering constituents from a bound hypervector) is combinatorially hard, involving an exponentially large search space [32]. This difficulty in "unbinding" limits the direct interpretability of composite hypervectors.

**Lack of Universal Encoder**: A universal encoder capable of mapping any arbitrary data type into HD space does not currently exist. Each type of encoder must be designed or adapted to map application-specific data after proper pre-processing [9].

**Handling Variability**: Early schema networks required all objects to share the same set of attributes and all schemas to share neighborhoods of the same size. Hypervector-based VSA systems aim to address this by enabling representations of arbitrary objects with varying numbers and types of attributes and encoding schemas in arbitrary neighborhoods [41]. Traditional schema learning approaches may struggle to deal with stochastic environments, particularly when confronted with contradicting or noisy observations [41].

**Interpretability**: Although HDC is often touted for its transparency, as its algebra can reveal the logic behind decisions unlike some black-box neural networks [5], specific challenges related to interpretability remain. The metaphorical power of high-dimensionality can sometimes mislead human intuition, as our cognitive systems are more attuned to three-dimensional spaces [42]. Furthermore, the conceptual motivations behind some hypervector representations can appear ad hoc, offering limited insight into their effectiveness [22]. While progress is being made in tools for visualization and understanding of ML models, including embedding visualizations [53], precisely understanding how certain noise (e.g., Differential Privacy noise) impacts model accuracy in a transparent way remains a challenge [31].

**Semantic Ambiguity**: Polysemy (a single word with multiple related meanings, e.g., "head" as a body part or a leader) and homonymy (words with the same spelling/pronunciation but unrelated meanings, e.g., "bank" as a financial institution or a river's edge) are inherent complexities in language [54]. Context is crucial for disambiguation, but this remains challenging for language processing systems [54]. The use of one-hot ground-truth relation labels in some models does not effectively represent the semantic similarities and distinctions among relations [59]. Moreover, inconsistent effects of ambiguity across tasks and difficulties in precisely defining response system configurations pose further hurdles [60].

### 5.3 Scalability Challenges

A significant hurdle for HDC, particularly in large-scale semantic knowledge graphs, is scalability. Current models struggle to handle the largest graphs due to GPU memory limits [61]. The increasing complexity of embedding models also makes them less tractable for huge graphs [62]. Distributed computation, a common solution, incurs high computational costs due to extensive data movement [62]. The need for regular recomputation to incorporate new entities adds to this burden [63]. Furthermore, the scale-free and connectivity properties of large knowledge graphs, with highly connected nodes and difficult partitioning, pose challenges for traditional algorithms [30]. This can lead to disconnected or imbalanced partitions, and slow eigenvector computation in spectral clustering [63].

Solutions are being developed, such as ScalableHD, which employs a two-stage pipelined execution model with memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding for high-throughput inference on multi-core CPUs [61]. Another approach, SEPAL, aims to enforce global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of entities and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message passing, utilizing algorithms like BLOCS for balanced subgraphs [62]. Leveraging distributed query processing systems, graph database layers, and cloud computing environments are also proposed solutions for managing the scale of knowledge graphs [65].

## 6. Conclusion

The exploration of semantic encoding with hypervectors reveals a compelling paradigm for advancing artificial intelligence, deeply rooted in cognitive science and brain-inspired computing. Semantic encoding in humans, characterized by deep, meaning-based processing, forms robust and retrievable memories. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) mirror these cognitive strengths by representing information in high-dimensional, distributed hypervectors, which are inherently robust to noise and errors.

The fundamental algebraic operations of bundling, binding, and permutation provide a powerful and interpretable framework for composing complex semantic structures. The "meaning" within HDC is not static or localized but emerges dynamically from the relationships and compositions formed by these operations, offering a flexible approach to knowledge representation. This relational and emergent understanding of meaning distinguishes HDC from purely symbolic systems and aligns it with connectionist theories of cognition, while still providing a structured algebraic foundation for symbolic-like manipulation.

HDC's unique properties, particularly its ability to leverage high dimensionality as an advantage rather than a limitation, make it suitable for efficient hardware implementation, suggesting a future where AI algorithms are intimately tied to specialized, brain-inspired computing architectures. The development of adaptive and learned encoders further enhances HDC's capacity to optimize representations for specific tasks, transcending static encoding schemes.

The applications of hypervector-based semantic encoding are broad and impactful, spanning machine learning, cognitive computing, and natural language processing. These demonstrations underscore HDC's potential to address complex AI challenges with efficiency, robustness, and a degree of transparency often lacking in other models.

However, significant challenges persist. The combinatorial complexity of decomposition, the absence of a universal encoder, and the intricate handling of semantic ambiguity and nuance remain active areas of research. Scalability for extremely large knowledge bases and graphs also presents a formidable hurdle, necessitating innovative solutions in distributed processing and graph partitioning.

Despite these challenges, the convergence of cognitive principles with computational design in HDC offers a promising path toward more efficient, robust, and transparent AI systems that emulate human-like cognitive abilities. Continued interdisciplinary research, focusing on both theoretical advancements and practical implementations, will be crucial in realizing the full potential of semantic encoding with hypervectors for the next generation of intelligent systems.
