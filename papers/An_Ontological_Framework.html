      <h2 class="section-title">Abstract</h2>
      <p>This paper develops an ontological framework that explains how meaning, knowledge, and intelligence arise—or fail—across minds, media, and institutions. Building on an agentic view of cognition, the framework models systems as networks of semantic agents operating under constraints (K), coupled by an interaction topology (T), and oriented by intentional vectors (I). Variations in the triplet ⟨K, T, I⟩ yield distinct modes of meaning, each with measurable signatures in semantic density, redundancy/entropy, and alignment. The account unifies structural and semantic perspectives, extends agent-based theories of mind by elevating constraint and intention to first-class variables, and predicts phase transitions between modes under parameter shifts. Brief illustrative vignettes are provided to demonstrate application. The framework supports diagnostics and design principles that resist semantic vampirism—surface mimicry that drains integrative meaning—and guides the construction of systems that cultivate generative meaning. Implications span cognitive science, epistemology, cultural analysis, and the ethics of AI-mediated media.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">1. Problem & Contribution</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">1.1 Problem Statement and Scope</h3>
      <p>Across contemporary discourse, artifacts and systems that are superficially similar differ radically in their capacity to produce durable meaning and reliable knowledge. Some configurations foster coherence, insight, and growth; others preserve only surface form while hollowing out integrative content. Existing approaches tend to bifurcate: structural accounts emphasize formal organization while underspecifying semantics and purpose; content-first accounts foreground interpretation while under-theorizing the generative role of structure and constraints. A unified ontology is needed—one that explains, at a level general enough to include minds, media, and institutions, how meaning and intelligence emerge, stabilize, degrade, or collapse.</p>

      <p>This paper addresses that gap by articulating a framework in which meaning, knowledge, and intelligence are treated as emergent properties of interacting semantic elements. The framework aims to be agnostic to medium and scale: it applies to narrative artifacts, scientific communication, organizational decision-making, and machine-generated outputs. Rather than diagnosing particular cultural products, the focus is to model the conditions under which systems generate, maintain, or drain meaning.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">1.2 Thesis and Core Claims</h3>
      <p><strong>Thesis.</strong> Meaningful intelligence is a system-level achievement produced by networks of semantic agents interacting under constraints (K), embedded in an interaction topology (T), and guided by intentional vectors (I). Parameterizations of ⟨K, T, I⟩ generate a finite set of meaning modes with predictable qualitative and quantitative signatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Core Claims:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>C1 (Ontological Unification).</strong> The same agentic ontology can explain meaning-making in minds, media, and institutions when constraints and intentional alignment are modeled explicitly alongside interaction structure.</li>
        <li><strong>C2 (Formal Mechanisms).</strong> A small set of neutral mechanism-modules—constraints (K), interaction topology (T), and intentional vectors (I)—functions as the theory's API.</li>
        <li><strong>C3 (Operational Metrics).</strong> Semantic density, redundancy/entropy, intentional alignment, and a vampirism coefficient provide measurable constructs for comparing systems.</li>
        <li><strong>C4 (Predictive Dynamics).</strong> Systematic variation in ⟨K, T, I⟩ induces phase transitions among modes.</li>
        <li><strong>C5 (Extension of Agent-Based Cognition).</strong> Agent-interaction theories are expanded by elevating constraint integrity and intentional vectors to first-class variables.</li>
        <li><strong>C6 (Applied Ethics and Design).</strong> The framework yields diagnostics and design principles to prevent semantic vampirism and cultivate generative meaning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">1.3 Contributions</h3>
      <p>The paper offers five primary contributions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ontology.</strong> A medium-agnostic account of semantic agents, their relations, and their embedding in constraint fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanism-Modules.</strong> Formalization of constraints (K), interaction topology (T), and intentional vectors (I) as neutral operators.</li>
        <li><strong>Typology.</strong> A finite set of meaning modes—including sacred silence, emergent chaos, positive construction, generative constraint, and semantic vampirism.</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics and Predictions.</strong> Operational measures and testable propositions about threshold effects and phase transitions.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics and Design Guidance.</strong> Practical procedures for analyzing existing systems and constructing new ones.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">1.4 Orientation and Roadmap</h3>
      <p>Section 2 states the ontological commitments and units of analysis. Section 3 defines the neutral mechanism-modules ⟨K, T, I⟩. Section 4 introduces operational metrics and measurement procedures. Section 5 presents the typology of meaning modes implied by the mechanism space. Section 6 articulates propositions and phase-transition predictions. Section 7 provides brief vignettes solely to illustrate application of the framework. Section 8 outlines methods for validation. Section 9 situates the account within related work. Section 10 discusses applications and ethical implications, followed by limitations (Section 11) and conclusion/future work (Section 12).</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">2. Ontological Commitments and Units of Analysis</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">2.1 Systems and Semantic Agents</h3>
      <p>A system is any medium-agnostic configuration in which meaning can arise (e.g., minds, narratives, organizations, technical artifacts). Its primitive constituents are <strong>semantic agents</strong>: minimal bearers and transformers of meaning such as tokens, motifs, scenes, procedures, rules, roles, or instruments. Agents may be nested and typed. Conceptually, "stories as societies of semantic agents" generalizes an agent-based cognitive stance to cultural and epistemic systems.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">2.2 Environments as Constraint Fields (K)</h3>
      <p>Each system is embedded in an environmental constraint field <strong>K</strong> that prunes or scaffolds possible states and trajectories. Constraints include formal rules (genre, logic, experimental design), material limits (time, budget, bandwidth), and institutional or platform incentives. Importantly, constraints are semantically neutral operators: depending on configuration, they can either enable emergent order ("productive constraints") or enforce empty forms divorced from meaning.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">2.3 Interaction Topology (T)</h3>
      <p>Agents are coupled by a multiplex interaction topology <strong>T</strong>: a labeled, possibly time-varying graph whose layers capture causal–temporal links, rhetorical moves, symbolic echoes, institutional relations, and other meaning-bearing couplings. Relation types include support, tension, contradiction, echo, negation, and silence. Under this view, meaning emerges from collision and negotiation among limited agents rather than from a central controller.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">2.4 Intentional Vectors (I)</h3>
      <p><strong>Intentional vectors I</strong> are directional pressures that bias how agents couple and how constraints are applied. They can originate at multiple levels—authorial/design intent, diegetic purposes internal to the system, and audience/observer frames—and may conflict or align. The alignment or misalignment among these vectors is an empirical property of a given system and a source of its felt meaning.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">2.5 States, Events, and Update Dynamics</h3>
      <p>A system trajectory is generated by an update operator <strong>s(t+1) = F_{⟨K,T,I⟩}(s(t), m(t))</strong>, where F composes constraint admissibility, topological propagation, and intentional bias. No central observer is assumed; global organization is an emergent consequence of distributed interaction under K, T, and I.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">2.6 Alignment Surfaces and Exogenous Fields</h3>
      <p>Define <strong>alignment A</strong> as the degree of coherence among intentional vectors across levels and with the constraint field. Alignment depends both on endogenous configuration and on exogenous fields (e.g., platform or institutional incentives) that act as global constraints. Alignment modulates phase transitions among meaning modes.</p>

    <div id="mechanisms" class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">3. Neutral Mechanism Modules (Theory "Functions")</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">3.1 Constraint K</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition.</strong> A constraint field K is an admissibility operator over system states and transformations. It delimits and/or scaffolds possible trajectories without, by itself, specifying content.</p>
      <p>The framework distinguishes <strong>productive constraints</strong> (which channel expression and help organize emergent order) from <strong>empty constraints</strong> (which reproduce the outward form of order while severing it from integrative meaning).</p>
      <p><strong>Parameters:</strong> strength (tight vs. loose), specificity (global vs. local), distribution (uniform vs. heterogeneous), and adaptivity (static vs. scaffolded/learning constraints).</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">3.2 Interaction Topology T</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition.</strong> T is a (possibly time-varying) multiplex graph over semantic agents. Edges encode meaning-bearing couplings such as support, tension, contradiction, echo, negation, or silence.</p>
      <p>When T promotes <strong>collision dynamics</strong>—frequent, structured encounters among agents—local definitions sharpen even in the absence of a single narrative authority.</p>
      <p><strong>Parameters:</strong> density (sparse–dense), hierarchy (flat–layered), clustering (low–high), and cyclicity (acyclic–recurrent).</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">3.3 Intentional Vectors I</h3>
      <p><strong>Definition.</strong> I denotes the directional forces of meaning-making—pressures originating in author/design intent, diegetic purposes, and audience/observer frames. These may align or conflict; alignment is treated as an empirical variable.</p>
      <p>Intentionality varies along a qualitative spectrum (e.g., sacred → profane → indifferent → anti-life).</p>
      <p><strong>Parameters:</strong> magnitude (strength of directional pressure), coherence (within-level consistency), and cross-level concordance (alignment among levels).</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">3.4 Edge Regimes and Failure Modes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Over-constraint without alignment</strong> produces brittle forms that mimic order while suppressing integrative meaning (empty constraint).</li>
        <li><strong>Surface topology without constraint integrity</strong> yields semantic vampirism: outward similarity to functional structures, but with drained interiority.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive constraints + aligned intentions</strong> support a generative regime in which semantic capacity grows through participation.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="metrics" class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">4. Derived Quantities and Metrics (Operationalization)</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">4.1 Semantic Density M</h3>
      <p><strong>Concept.</strong> The meaning-bearing capacity of an artifact/system; meaning is treated as a relational quality, not mere quantity of content.</p>
      <p><strong>Operationalization:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relational compression: M ∝ 1/codelength under compression models that exploit agent–agent couplings</li>
        <li>Cross-layer mutual information: M = MI(form; function) across representational layers</li>
        <li>Human judgment anchored to structure: ratings of "coherent, non-redundant insight per unit"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">4.2 Redundancy and Entropy R, H</h3>
      <p>Null and vampiric regimes exhibit high surface repetition with weak integrative relations—consistent with elevated redundancy and/or disorder.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">4.3 Intentional Alignment A</h3>
      <p><strong>Concept.</strong> Alignment of intentional pressures at multiple levels (authorial/design, diegetic, audience).</p>
      <p><strong>Operationalization:</strong> Within-level coherence and cross-level concordance measured via cosine similarity among vector embeddings or Procrustes fit.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">4.4 Topological Coherence C_T</h3>
      <p>Global efficiency / path coherence: inverse characteristic path length among meaning-bearing edges. Coherent global organization is an emergent property of T.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">4.5 Vampirism Coefficient V</h3>
      <p><strong>Concept.</strong> Surface similarity to functional stories combined with absence of interiority/purpose and active meaning drain.</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> V = SurfaceSim − α·C_T − β·A − γ·M</p>
      <p>High V flags "mechanical reproduction of form" and anti-life intentionality.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">4.6 Developmental Gain ΔG</h3>
      <p>Measures semantic capacity growth through participation: ΔG(t) = M(t+τ) − M(t) for participants exposed to scaffolded K and aligned I.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">5.5 Mode V — Semantic Vampirism (Hollow Mimicry)</h3>
      <p><strong>Configuration:</strong> Empty or decoupled constraint (K degraded); surface-level topology that mimics functional structure (T: mechanical "puppet-show" coupling); intentional vectors anti-life or negating possibility (I: misaligned/hostile).</p>
      <p><strong>Metrics:</strong> V high; M low or negative (draining); R high with H that signals uninformative repetition; A low; C_T brittle and superficial.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">6. Propositions and Phase Transitions</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">6.1 Constraint-Driven Transitions</h3>
      <p><strong>P1 — Productive-constraint induction of Mode I (Sacred Silence).</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Increase strength/specificity of K while preserving its productive character.<br>
      Prediction: System moves toward sparse, high-signal organization with elevated M and reduced H/R.<br>
      Signatures: Rise in M; drop in H/R; stable or improving C_T; low V.</p>

      <p><strong>P2 — Empty-constraint collapse into Mode V (Vampirism).</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Substitute empty constraints that reproduce surface order while severing integrative purpose.<br>
      Prediction: System presents superficial form with decoupled interiority and misaligned or hostile I; transition to Mode V.<br>
      Signatures: V rises as SurfaceSim outpaces C_T, A, and M; agent interactions become mechanical.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">6.2 Topology-Driven Transitions</h3>
      <p><strong>P3 — Collision-rich topology induces Mode II (Emergent Chaos).</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Reduce global K and increase collision dynamics in T while ensuring genuine agency.<br>
      Prediction: Emergence of local pockets of high M amid global drift; distributed organization without central controller.<br>
      Signatures: Local C_T↑ with global C_T uneven; M shows local spikes; A fragmented but not negating.</p>

      <p><strong>P4 — Coherent, layered topology with moderate K yields Mode III (Positive Construction).</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Impose moderate, structured K and a layered, integrative T.<br>
      Prediction: Stable, positive M with low–moderate redundancy; high C_T.<br>
      Signatures: High C_T across layers; low H/R; robustness of global coherence.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">6.3 Intentionality and Alignment</h3>
      <p><strong>P5 — Intentional alignment elevates coherence and density.</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Increase alignment among authorial, diegetic, and audience vectors.<br>
      Prediction: Transition toward Modes III/IV depending on K and T: higher M, stronger C_T, reduced redundancy.</p>

      <p><strong>P6 — Hostile or anti-life vectors catalyze vampiric drift.</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Tilt I toward anti-life or sustained misalignment.<br>
      Prediction: Even with recognizable surface T, the system drifts toward Mode V; meaning is actively drained.<br>
      Signatures: Intentionality scores shift toward anti-life; V increases; "uncanny valley of narrative."</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">6.4 Developmental (Generative) Regime</h3>
      <p><strong>P7 — Scaffolded constraints plus devotional intention produce developmental gain (Mode IV).</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Introduce adaptive/scaffolded K and align I toward devotional purpose; maintain participatory T.<br>
      Prediction: Sustained ΔG > 0: semantic density increases over time for participating agents.<br>
      Signatures: Addition of "developmental" to interaction spectrum; devotional intentionality mode.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">6.5 Phase Boundaries and Exogenous Fields</h3>
      <p><strong>P8 — Threshold behavior and hysteresis at mode boundaries.</strong></p>
      <p>Prediction: Non-linear transitions among Modes I–V; systems can remain trapped in degraded regions even after partial parameter reversal.</p>

      <p><strong>P9 — Exogenous incentive fields bias dynamics toward entropy and vampirism unless countered.</strong></p>
      <p>Intervention: Introduce platform/institutional incentives that reward output volume or surface similarity.<br>
      Prediction: Drift toward Null/Vampiric regions (H/R↑, V↑) unless K and I are deliberately re-engineered.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">7. Illustrative Vignettes</h2>
      <p><em>These vignettes are strictly illustrative applications of the framework; they do not drive the argument or carry evidentiary weight beyond exemplification.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Mode I — Sacred Silence (Soviet anti-aesthetic).</strong> Soviet material culture functions as art through ostensible lack of art: meaning appears via disciplined negation rather than ornament, yielding "meaningful absence" with coherent suppression and sacred orientation. Semantic Density: Negative, Interaction: Coherent, Intentionality: Sacred, producing the felt "haunted chapel."</p>

      <p><strong>Mode II — Emergent Chaos (The Big Lebowski).</strong> Definition arises from collisions among agents without central narrative authority. Semantic Density: Negative (via anti-narrative), Interaction: Emergent, Intentionality: Profane, resulting in "distributed consciousness without center."</p>

      <p><strong>Mode III — Positive Construction (The Simpsons, "Do It For Her").</strong> A classical arc with clear motivation and "earned sentiment" aligns narrative vectors; coherent agent interaction and sacred intentionality generate stable, constructive meaning.</p>

      <p><strong>Mode IV — Generative Constraint (Terminator 2).</strong> Meaning grows through participation under scaffolded constraints and devotional intentionality—"machines learning humanity through narrative participation." Transformative Semantic Density, Developmental Interaction, and Devotional Intentionality.</p>

      <p><strong>Mode V — Semantic Vampirism (Mr. Birchum).</strong> Surface similarity to functional stories coexists with "mechanical reproduction of form" and absence of interiority or purpose—an anti-life vector that actively drains neighboring semantic space. Semantic Density: Vampiric, Interaction: Mechanical (puppet show), Intentionality: Anti-Life, yielding the "synthetic morgue" effect.</p>

    <div id="methods" class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">8. Methods for Application and Validation</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">8.1 Corpus Selection and Unitization</h3>
      <p>Select corpora spanning narratives, artifacts, and institutional documents to ensure medium-agnostic evaluation. Unitize content into semantic agents (tokens, motifs, roles, procedures) at micro/meso/macro grain. Map agents to axes for preliminary placement along Semantic Density, Agent Interaction, and Intentionality spectra.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">8.2 Annotation Protocol for ⟨K, T, I⟩</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Constraints (K):</strong> Identify productive vs. empty constraints; label scope, strength, and adaptivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction topology (T):</strong> Encode meaning-bearing couplings (support, tension, contradiction, echo, negation, silence); mark collision dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>Intentional vectors (I):</strong> Record stated or inferred orientations at authorial/design, diegetic, and audience levels; note alignment/misalignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Frame management:</strong> Annotate frame shifts (adaptive vs. rigid vs. absent).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">8.3 Metric Computation</h3>
      <p>Compute core observables: Semantic Density (M), Redundancy/Entropy (R/H), Topological Coherence (C_T), Intentional Alignment (A), Vampirism coefficient (V). Interpret against named spectra.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">8.4 Experimental Designs</h3>
      <p><strong>A. Synthetic generation:</strong> Programmatically vary constraint strength/adaptivity, topological collision rates, and intentional alignment to test predicted mode transitions.</p>
      <p><strong>B. Human rating studies:</strong> Collect perceived-meaning and coherence ratings while cueing raters to relational structure.</p>
      <p><strong>C. Frame-perturbation experiments:</strong> Introduce controlled frame prompts and measure downstream changes in M and C_T.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">8.5 Comparative and Longitudinal Analyses</h3>
      <p>Map historical vs. contemporary/AI-mediated outputs to test clustering near Null/Vampiric regions under modern incentive fields. Observe systems over time as exogenous constraints shift; test for hysteresis and trapping in degraded regimes.</p>

    <div id="related" class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">9. Related Work</h2>

      <p>This section situates the framework relative to work in cognitive science, narratology and semiotics, aesthetics and constraint-based creativity, information-theoretic accounts of meaning, developmental theories of learning, systems and cybernetics, and contemporary analyses of generative media.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">9.1 Agent-Based Accounts of Mind and Cognition</h3>
      <p>The present framework adopts the agentic stance but elevates constraint and intentional vectors to first-class variables alongside interaction structure. The result is a generalized ontology in which cognitive, cultural, and institutional artifacts are all analyzable as societies of semantic agents embedded in constraint fields and subject to directional pressures.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">9.2 Structuralist and Semiotic Narratology</h3>
      <p>The current account retains an interest in structure but shifts from static morphology to dynamic topology. It specifies operational metrics that quantify differences among regimes. Where classical narratology classifies, the present approach models how systems move between regimes as constraints and intentionality vary.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">9.3 Aesthetics of Constraint and Generative Creativity</h3>
      <p>The framework's contribution is to treat constraint as a neutral operator K whose effect depends on its coupling with T and I. It separates productive constraints from empty constraints, accounting for why similar formal limitations can yield opposite qualitative outcomes.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">9.4 Information-Theoretic and Complexity Approaches</h3>
      <p>The present framework adopts information-theoretic tools but anchors them to relational semantics: semantic density is treated not merely as compressibility but as meaning-bearing coupling across levels. The vampirism coefficient formalizes a failure mode specific to contemporary media.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">9.5 Developmental and Participatory Theories</h3>
      <p>The proposed Mode IV (Generative Constraint) integrates socio-constructivist and apprenticeship-based accounts by defining a developmental regime with trajectory-level gains in semantic capacity (ΔG>0).</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">9.6 Systems Theory and Cybernetics</h3>
      <p>The framework introduces an explicit alignment surface A among multi-level intentional vectors and the constraint field, treating alignment as an empirical variable that modulates stability and transition thresholds.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">10. Applications and Ethical Implications</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">10.1 Diagnostic Toolkit</h3>
      <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> (1) Unitize into semantic agents; annotate ⟨K, T, I⟩. (2) Score metrics: compute M, H/R, C_T, A, and V. (3) Mode inference using the typology. (4) Identify levers for improvement. (5) Report annotations and metric values.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">10.2 Design Principles (anti-vampiric practice)</h3>
      <p><strong>Constraint integrity (K):</strong> Employ productive constraints that prune possibilities while preserving interior purpose; avoid empty constraints.</p>
      <p><strong>Topology as craft (T):</strong> Design for genuine collisions among agents; balance local density with global coherence.</p>
      <p><strong>Intentional alignment (I):</strong> Make ends explicit; ensure cross-level alignment; detect and correct anti-life or negating vectors.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">10.3 AI-Mediated Pipelines and Tools</h3>
      <p><strong>Pipeline checkpoints:</strong> Pre-production K/I registration, topology audit prior to release, anti-simulacrum gate (compute V and block deployments above threshold).</p>
      <p><strong>Model/data hygiene:</strong> Curate training corpora to maintain constraint diversity and intentional integrity; use contrastive objectives that penalize surface match without integrative coupling.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">10.4 Scientific Communication</h3>
      <p>Treat protocols, claims, and instruments as agents; enforce productive K via explicit method constraints. Structure T to increase constructive cycles and reduce cargo-cult citation loops. Align I via transparent problem statements.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">10.5 Platform and Product Design</h3>
      <p>Reweight recommendation objectives to favor M and C_T rather than pure engagement. Penalize V in ranking functions. Provide creator dashboards exposing K/T/I annotations and metric feedback.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">10.6 Ethical Risks</h3>
      <p><strong>Metric gaming:</strong> Mitigate by rotating metric families, publishing annotations, including human relational judgments.</p>
      <p><strong>Normative overreach:</strong> Treat I spectra as empirical descriptors; incorporate plural intentional vocabularies.</p>
      <p><strong>Manipulative alignment:</strong> Disclose intentional goals; enable counter-speech and independent audits.</p>

    <div id="limitations" class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">11. Limitations and Scope Conditions</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">11.1 Conceptual Limits</h3>
      <p>The framework supplies an analytic ontology for comparing systems; it does not claim a final metaphysical account of meaning. Treating constraints, topology, and intentional vectors as sufficient generators is a useful idealization.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">11.2 Measurement and Identifiability</h3>
      <p>Metrics such as M, C_T, A, and V are proxies. Unitization introduces coder subjectivity. Different ⟨K, T, I⟩ configurations may yield observationally similar signatures (equifinality). Temporal grain matters—short windows can misclassify transient turbulence.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">11.3 Domain Constraints</h3>
      <p>The framework applies when agent interactions are meaningful and identifiable, constraints are observable, and intentional traces are available. For artifacts with minimal relational structure, the agent graph may be too sparse.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">11.4 Cultural Variability</h3>
      <p>The Sacred→Profane→Indifferent→Anti-Life axis is an analytic descriptor, not a universal moral taxonomy. Cross-cultural calibration required. High alignment A can reflect coherent but harmful ends.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">11.5 Goodharting and Adversarial Behavior</h3>
      <p>Systems can optimize to look coherent without genuine gains in M. Adversarial mimicry can evade V-gates. Countermeasures include rotating metric families and contrastive training.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">12. Conclusion & Future Work</h2>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">12.1 Summary</h3>
      <p>This paper proposed an ontological and operational account of how meaning, knowledge, and intelligence arise across minds, media, and institutions. Systems were modeled as networks of semantic agents operating under constraints K, coupled by interaction topology T, and oriented by intentional vectors I. Variations in ⟨K, T, I⟩ yield a finite typology of meaning modes with measurable signatures.</p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">12.2 Core Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Unified ontology: medium-agnostic specification of agents, relations, constraint fields, and intentional vector fields</li>

        <li>Operationalization: metrics translating qualitative impressions into observable quantities</li>
        <li>Typology and dynamics: five modes with phase-transition predictions</li>
        <li>Diagnostics and design: procedures to reduce V and increase M, C_T, A, and ΔG</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">12.4 Design & Governance Agenda</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creators:</strong> Specify productive constraints, craft genuine collisions, disclose intentional ends; self-audit with M, C_T, A, V</li>
        <li><strong>AI teams:</strong> Pre-register K/I, instrument C_T and V, penalize surface-only objectives</li>
        <li><strong>Institutions:</strong> Reweight incentives to favor coherence and semantic growth; monitor drift toward vampiric regions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">12.5 Concluding Principle</h3>
      <p>The practical upshot is a compact maxim: <strong>protect semantic space</strong>. Preserve constraint integrity, design for genuine agent collisions, align intentions across levels, and penalize hollow surface mimicry. The framework provides both a conceptual lens and a measurement toolkit to move from diagnosis by metaphor to diagnosis by mechanism.</p>
