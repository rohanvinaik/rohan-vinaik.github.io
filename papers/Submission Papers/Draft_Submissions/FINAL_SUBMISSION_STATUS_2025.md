     - Technical challenges (cross-talk, noise, scaling)
     - Biological constraints (evolutionary compatibility)
     - Engineering challenges (design, testing, validation)
   - **Time:** 1-2 days

#### MINOR: Technical Corrections (Priority: MEDIUM)

1. **Verify dimensionality calculations** (Section 3-5)
   - Check: Are dimensionality estimates biologically plausible?
   - Time: 1 day

2. **Clarify notation** (Throughout)
   - Standardize: Vector notation, operation symbols
   - Add: Notation table/glossary
   - Time: 1 day

### Action Plan (4-6 weeks)

**Week 1: Literature Review**
- [ ] **Days 1-2:** HDC papers (find and read 15-20 papers)
- [ ] **Days 3-4:** Biological computation papers (find and read 10-15)
- [ ] **Day 5:** Synthetic biology papers (find and read 8-12)

**Week 2: Continue Literature + Start Figures**
- [ ] **Days 1-2:** Stem cell and cross-disciplinary papers (find and read 10-15)
- [ ] **Days 2-3:** Integrate citations throughout paper
- [ ] **Days 4-5:** Create Figures 1-2 (HDC operations, Protein encoding)

**Week 3: Figures + Content Expansion**
- [ ] **Days 1-2:** Create Figures 3-4 (DNA circuits, Neural coding)
- [ ] **Days 3-4:** Create Figures 5-6 (Stem cell landscape, Synthetic biology)
- [ ] **Day 5:** Expand Experimental Validation section

**Week 4: Content + Figures Completion**
- [ ] **Days 1-2:** Create Figures 7-8 (Performance, Applications)
- [ ] **Day 3:** Add quantitative analysis throughout
- [ ] **Day 4:** Expand Introduction and Discussion
- [ ] **Day 5:** Add comparison to alternative approaches

**Week 5-6: Integration & Refinement**
- [ ] **Days 1-2:** Integrate all figures into LaTeX
- [ ] **Days 2-3:** Adjust text to reference figures
- [ ] **Days 4-5:** Technical corrections, notation standardization
- [ ] **Days 6-7:** Multiple LaTeX compilations, citation cleanup
- [ ] **Days 8-10:** Proofreading, final checks, formatting

**Estimated Total Time:** 20-25 full days of work

### Alternative Approach: Scale Down to Submit Sooner

If 4-6 weeks is too long, consider submitting as a **"Letter" or "Short Communication"** format:

**Revised Scope:**
- Focus on ONE substrate (e.g., proteins only)
- Reduce to 6-8 pages
- 3-4 figures only
- 20-25 references (more manageable)
- Frame as "preliminary communication" or "perspective"

**Time Required:** 1-2 weeks

**Trade-off:** Less impact, but faster publication and establishes priority

### Submission Checklist (After Full Refinements)
- [ ] All 8 figures created and integrated
- [ ] 40-60 references added and integrated
- [ ] Experimental validation expanded/reframed
- [ ] Quantitative analysis added throughout
- [ ] Comparison to alternatives included
- [ ] Discussion of challenges/limitations added
- [ ] Final LaTeX compilation clean
- [ ] Visit BioSystems submission portal (Elsevier)
- [ ] Upload PDF + LaTeX source
- [ ] Complete submission form
- [ ] Suggest 4-5 reviewers
- [ ] Confirm submission

**Suggested Reviewers:**
- Ehud Shapiro (Weizmann) - DNA computing, biological computation
- Lulu Qian (Caltech) - DNA circuits, molecular programming
- Chris Voigt (MIT) - synthetic biology, genetic circuits
- Denis Kleyko (HDC in unconventional substrates)
- Christof Koch (neural coding, population representations)

## COMPILATION FIXES APPLIED (October 26, 2025)

### Issue 1: Black Box Framework - natbib Bibliography Error
**Error:** "Bibliography not compatible with author-year citations"
**Cause:** Paper uses `\bibitem` (numeric) but natbib was in default (author-year) mode
**Fix:** Changed `\usepackage{natbib}` → `\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}` (line 11)
**Result:** ✅ Compiles successfully, 21 pages

### Issue 2: COEC Framework - natbib Bibliography Error
**Error:** "Bibliography not compatible with author-year citations"
**Cause:** Same as Black Box—numeric bibliography with author-year natbib
**Fix:** Changed `\usepackage{natbib}` → `\usepackage[numbers]{natbib}` (line 11)
**Result:** ✅ Compiles successfully, 27 pages

### Issue 3: Ontological Framework - Minor Warnings
**Error:** Hyperref warnings about math in PDF bookmarks (non-critical)
**Cause:** Section titles contain LaTeX math commands
**Fix:** None needed—these warnings don't affect PDF generation
**Result:** ✅ Compiles successfully, 55 pages (warnings expected and harmless)

### Issue 4: Narrative Ethics - Already Clean
**Status:** ✅ No errors, compiles perfectly (19 pages)

### Issue 5: Biocomputing HDC - Already Clean
**Status:** ✅ No errors, compiles perfectly (22 pages)
