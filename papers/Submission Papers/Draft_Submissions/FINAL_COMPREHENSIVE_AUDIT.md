## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**Overall Audit Confidence:** VERY HIGH

This audit is based on:
- ✓ Actual venue requirements (web-researched)
- ✓ PDF compilation verification
- ✓ Page count measurements
- ✓ File size checks
- ✓ LaTeX log analysis
- ✓ Existing compliance reports
- ✓ Submission summaries

**Limitations:**
- Cannot verify every citation resolves (would need manual check)
- Cannot verify figure quality (for papers with figures)
- Cannot assess novelty vs. existing literature (would need domain expertise)
- Cannot predict reviewer preferences

**Recommendation validity:** This audit provides accurate assessment of format compliance and technical readiness. Content quality assessments are based on structure, rigor, and existing documentation.
