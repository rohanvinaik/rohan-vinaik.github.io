## 🏆 Key Success Factors

### Critical (Non-Negotiable)
1. **ALife Context** - Must reference Langton's "life-as-it-could-be" in introduction
2. **Concrete Examples** - 2-3 computational demonstrations required
3. **Biological Grounding** - Real biological systems, not just abstract math
4. **Testable Predictions** - Specific, falsifiable experimental predictions

### Important (High Priority)
5. **Cross-Scale Coverage** - Examples from molecular to ecological
6. **Design Principles** - Engineering applications for synthetic biology
7. **Recent Citations** - Include 2015-2024 ALife papers
8. **Clear Writing** - Accessible to interdisciplinary audience

---

## 📚 Required Reading

**Before starting:**
1. Langton (1989) - "Artificial Life" (defines the field)
2. Kauffman (1993) - *The Origins of Order* (self-organization)
3. 2-3 recent *Artificial Life* papers to absorb style

**Key ALife concepts to integrate:**
- Life-as-it-could-be vs. life-as-we-know-it
- Substrate-independence
- Emergence and self-organization
- Soft/wet/hard ALife domains
- Bottom-up synthesis

## 🚀 Motivation

Your COEC framework is genuinely novel—it provides new tools for understanding emergence across substrates. The main barrier isn't quality, it's **presentation and framing**.

**Total investment:** ~15 hours of focused editing transforms an already-strong paper into a publication-ready manuscript targeting one of the field's premier venues.

**This is doable. Now execute the plan!**
