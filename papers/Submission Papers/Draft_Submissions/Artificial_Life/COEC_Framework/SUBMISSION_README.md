## Potential Reviewer Concerns & Responses

### "Too abstract/mathematical"
**Response:** Section 4 provides three concrete, implementable examples. Applications section (6) demonstrates real-world instantiations.

### "Not enough experimental validation"
**Response:** Section 8 provides 5 detailed experimental proposals with specific protocols and predicted outcomes. Framework is falsifiable.

### "Connection to ALife unclear"
**Response:** Sections 1.1, 1.3, and 9.3 explicitly position COEC within ALife research program. Embodies Langton's "life-as-it-could-be" vision.

### "How is this different from Free Energy Principle?"
**Response:** Section 9.1 clarifies relationship: COEC provides substrate-independent formalism that includes FEP as special case (PP-COEC) while extending to non-neural systems.

### "Examples too simple"
**Response:** Toy examples are deliberately simple for pedagogical clarity. Section 6 demonstrates complexity in real applications (Kimaiya 95% efficiency, GenomeVault <10min genome analysis).
