## üìù Notes

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.** Quality submissions take time. Budget 15-20 hours per paper minimum. Don't rush. Get feedback. Revise thoroughly. Submit when ready.

**Rejection is normal.** Even the best papers get rejected 1-2 times. It's part of the process. Learn from reviews, improve, and resubmit.

**You have excellent work.** These frameworks are genuinely novel and interesting. The barrier isn't quality‚Äîit's presentation and fit. These guides help you nail both.

**Now pick a paper and start working through its README. You've got this! üéØ**
