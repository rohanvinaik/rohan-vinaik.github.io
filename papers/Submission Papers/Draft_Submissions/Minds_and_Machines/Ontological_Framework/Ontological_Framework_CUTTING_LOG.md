## Compression Techniques Used

### 1. Structural Elimination
- Removed subsection headers where content could flow as paragraphs
- Eliminated enumerated lists in favor of prose integration
- Deleted "In this section..." / "As mentioned previously..." transitional phrases

### 2. List Compression
- Converted bullet lists to comma/semicolon-separated inline lists
- Merged multi-level nested lists into single-level parenthetical structures
- Example: "Agents: (1) tokens, (2) attention heads..." → "Agents (tokens, attention heads, ...)"

### 3. Redundancy Elimination
- Removed repeated explanations of framework components across sections
- Deleted examples where citations suffice
- Eliminated verbose transitional and explanatory phrases

### 4. Dense Paragraph Formation
- Merged multiple short paragraphs into single dense paragraphs
- Integrated configuration/metrics/examples for typology modes
- Combined intervention/prediction/signatures for propositions

### 5. Strategic Content Relocation
- Moved non-essential examples to supplement
- Relocated standard limitations discussion to supplement (common practice)

## Recommendations for Authors

### If Further Cuts Needed (Target <25 pages):
1. Further compress Related Work section (currently 1.5 pages → could be 1 page)
2. Reduce Ontological Commitments section by merging definitions into flowing prose
3. Compress Mechanism Modules section parameter lists

### If Expansion Possible (≤30 pages):
1. Restore some AI systems analysis detail (GPT-4 configuration specifics)
2. Expand validation methodology with more procedural detail
3. Add back 1-2 illustrative vignettes for Mode I and Mode V

### For Revision Based on Reviewer Feedback:
- Content in online supplement can be selectively restored if reviewers request
- Vignettes can be moved back if reviewers want concrete examples
- Limitations can be abbreviated and moved back if venue requires
- AI systems section can be expanded if reviewers want more LLM analysis
