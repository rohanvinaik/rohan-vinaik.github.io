## üìã Quick Overview

### Paper Core
**Title:** "Machines, Morality, and Narrative: A Framework for Machine Ethics Through Narrative Learning"

**Thesis:** Machine ethics should be grounded in narrative understanding, not rule-based systems. Uses T2: Judgment Day as conceptual case study.

- Core M&M topic (machine ethics)
- Novel approach to longstanding problem
- Builds on established cognitive architecture
- Clear philosophical argumentation
- Practical implications for AI development

## üéØ Key Strengths

**Strong Points:**
‚úÖ Addresses central machine ethics problem
‚úÖ Novel narrative-based approach
‚úÖ Builds on Minsky's cognitive architecture
‚úÖ Engages existing machine ethics literature
‚úÖ Accessible philosophical writing
‚úÖ Cultural angle (narrative learning from stories)

**Minor Concerns:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Science fiction example may seem speculative (address in introduction)
‚ö†Ô∏è Less formal than typical M&M (but acceptable for ethics papers)

## üí° Success Tips

1. **Justify sci-fi example early** - It's a philosophical thought experiment
2. **Connect to contemporary AI** - Show relevance to LLM alignment
3. **Engage seriously with alternatives** - Why not rule-based systems?
4. **Emphasize cognitive grounding** - Not just literary theory
5. **Discuss limitations** - What doesn't narrative approach solve?
6. **Write accessibly** - Machine ethics appeals to broad audience
