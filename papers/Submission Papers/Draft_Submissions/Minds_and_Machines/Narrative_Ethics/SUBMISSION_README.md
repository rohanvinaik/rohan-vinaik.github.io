## Paper Overview

### Abstract (241 words)

Contemporary approaches to machine ethics face a fundamental limitation: they treat moral knowledge as explicitly programmable rules, optimizable utility functions, or predefined character traits, neglecting how humans actually acquire ethical understanding through narrative immersion. This paper proposes an alternative framework grounded in Marvin Minsky's cognitive architecture, wherein moral development occurs through story-based learning rather than rule internalization. The framework addresses three key limitations of current approaches—rigidity in novel contexts, difficulty capturing moral nuance, and the frame problem for ethical reasoning—while providing a more developmentally plausible pathway to moral competence.

Drawing on science fiction narratives as philosophical thought experiments, particularly *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, the paper demonstrates how narrative immersion can generate flexible ethical reasoning without requiring conscious emotional states. The framework has immediate practical implications for contemporary AI development, including narrative-based training regimes analogous to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), story-comprehension benchmarks for evaluating large language models, and hybrid architectures combining narrative understanding with explicit safety constraints.

The paper defends this approach against objections concerning consciousness, alignment risks, cultural specificity, and verification challenges, arguing that narrative-based moral learning provides a promising path toward AI systems capable of robust ethical reasoning in complex real-world contexts.

## Key Contributions

1. **Theoretical Framework**: Novel synthesis of Minsky's cognitive architecture with machine ethics, showing how frames, scripts, trans-frames, and K-lines support moral learning through narratives

2. **Contemporary Relevance**: Direct connections to current AI systems (LLMs, RLHF) and value alignment challenges

3. **Philosophical Depth**: Engages machine ethics literature thoroughly (Wallach & Allen, Anderson & Anderson, Vallor) while drawing on broader philosophy (virtue epistemology, care ethics, existentialism)

4. **Thought Experiment Analysis**: Detailed philosophical case study of *Terminator 2* demonstrating framework coherence and revealing insights about moral agency independent of consciousness

5. **Practical Implementation**: Concrete proposals for narrative-based training, evaluation benchmarks, and hybrid architectures

6. **Defense Against Objections**: Thorough engagement with four major objections (consciousness, alignment, cultural specificity, verification)

## Fit with *Minds and Machines*

**Excellent fit (88/100 estimated):**

- ✅ Core machine ethics topic (central to M&M scope)
- ✅ Novel approach to longstanding problem
- ✅ Builds on established cognitive architecture (Minsky)
- ✅ Engages machine ethics literature thoroughly
- ✅ Contemporary AI relevance (LLMs, RLHF, alignment)
- ✅ Clear philosophical argumentation
- ✅ Practical implementation implications
- ✅ Interdisciplinary (AI, philosophy, cognitive science)

**Potential Concerns Addressed:**

- Science fiction example justified as philosophical thought experiment (Section 5.4)
- Contemporary AI connections throughout (Section 7 entirely devoted to LLMs and practical implications)
- Technical feasibility demonstrated (Section 3.3)
- Rigorous philosophical defense against objections (Section 6)

## Key Enhancements from Original

### 1. Contemporary AI Integration

- **LLM focus**: Extensive discussion of GPT-4, Claude, RLHF, Constitutional AI
- **Practical applications**: Narrative-aware RLHF, story comprehension benchmarks
- **Current challenges**: Reward misspecification, alignment problems in deployed systems

### 2. Strengthened Machine Ethics Engagement

- **Rule-based approaches**: GenEth, principle of double effect, Asimov's laws
- **Consequentialist approaches**: RLHF, inverse RL, reward hacking
- **Virtue ethics**: Vallor's technomoral virtues, character trait cultivation
- **Comparative analysis**: Why narrative learning addresses limitations of all three

### 3. Philosophical Depth

- **Thought experiment justification**: Why Terminator 2 functions as valid philosophical argument
- **Philosophical mirrors**: Lacan, Foucault, institutional power analysis
- **Alternative moral paths**: Karma yoga parallel, action vs. intention
- **Virtue epistemology**: Moral knowledge as practical skill (Sosa, Greco)

### 4. Implementation Detail

- **Curated narrative corpora**: Specific content types and sources
- **Multi-stage training**: Scaffolded learning from simple to complex narratives
- **Architectural requirements**: Frame-based representations, causal reasoning, analogical transfer
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining narrative learning with safety constraints
- **Evaluation methods**: Five distinct testing approaches

### 5. Objection Defense

- **Consciousness**: Why phenomenology isn't necessary for moral reasoning
- **Alignment**: How narrative learning compares to alternatives on safety
- **Cultural specificity**: Advantages for addressing moral pluralism
- **Verification**: Multiple testing approaches for genuine understanding
