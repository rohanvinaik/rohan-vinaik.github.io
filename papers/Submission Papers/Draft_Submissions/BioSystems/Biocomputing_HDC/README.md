## 🎯 Extraction Strategy

### Core Narrative
**Title:** "Hyperdimensional Computing in Biological Substrates: Framework and Implementation Principles"

**Focus:** Extract ~60% of current biocomputing paper into focused narrative on HDC in biological systems

### What to Keep (8-10k words)
1. **Section 2:** Biomolecular Substrates (compress to 2,500 words)
   - DNA/RNA computing foundations
   - Protein-based computation
   - Cellular signaling networks

2. **Section 3:** Hyperdimensional Computing in Biological Systems (3,000 words) ⭐ CORE
   - HDC principles
   - Biological instantiation
   - Semantic encoding in biomolecules

3. **Section 4:** Computational Framework (2,000 words)
   - Algorithms section
   - Binding/bundling operations
   - Similarity measures

4. **Applications:** Focus on synthetic biology ONLY (1,500 words)
   - Gene circuit design
   - Cellular programming
   - Bioengineering applications

### What to Cut
- ❌ Detailed implementation section (save for future paper)
- ❌ Extensive feasibility analysis (too speculative)
- ❌ Resource requirements
- ❌ Broad future directions
- ❌ Manufacturing/fabrication details
