*This checklist provides a systematic path from current draft to submission-ready manuscript. Allocate 1-2 hours per day over 6 weeks for steady progress, or work in intensive blocks.*

**REMEMBER:** Quality over speed. Better to take 6 weeks and submit a strong paper than rush a mediocre submission.
