## What Makes This Paper Different

**Traditional biocomputing:** Forces biology into digital logic abstractions (DNA logic gates, genetic circuits as electronic analogs)

**This paper:** Shows biology naturally implements hyperdimensional computing through its intrinsic high-dimensional encoding (protein conformations, gene expression, neural codes)

**Impact:** Shifts perspective from "how to make biology compute like silicon" to "what computational paradigms does biology naturally excel at"
